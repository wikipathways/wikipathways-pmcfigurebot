caption: 'Comparative transcriptomic analysis in muscle biopsies of cachectic NSCLC
  patients and OLCC mice. (A) Volcano plot of RNA sequencing data of newly diagnosed
  treatment naïve non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with cachexia (n = 8)
  compared with age‐ and gender‐matched healthy controls (n = 8; left panel) and OLCC
  mice (n = 4) compared with sham control (n = 4; right panel). Volcano plots are
  depicted with fold change (Log 2) and significance (‐Log 10 adjusted P‐value). Significantly
  upregulated genes are shown in red, while significantly downregulated genes are
  shown in blue. (B) Horizontal bar chart of enriched biological pathways among significantly
  downregulated genes in NSCLC patients with cachexia (left panel) and OLCC mice (right
  panel). Enriched biological pathways are derived from three independent databases:
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; black bars), Reactome (orange bars)
  and WikiPathways (green bars). Overlapping pathways NSCLC patients with cachexia
  and OLCC mice are indicated with a hashtag (#).'
