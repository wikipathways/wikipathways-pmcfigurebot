caption: 'Subnetwork from the APOE4 case study. Enrichment analysis was performed
  on the top 100 up-regulated genes of postmortem brains from APOE4 carriers compared
  with the non-carriers extracted from the Blanchard et al. study. The KEGG Pathways,
  WikiPathways, DISEASES, DisGeNET and MGI Mammalian Phenotype gene set libraries
  were selected for the analysis. A subnetwork that connects the top enriched terms
  and the up-regulated genes that appear in at least two libraries is shown. The query
  can be accessed via the following URL: https://maayanlab.cloud/turl/199918c6.'
