caption: 'The dynamic changes of eIF2 O-GlcNAcylation upon ArgS. A A Venn diagram
  was generated to depict the overlap between 2054 O-GlcNAz-modified proteins that
  were pulled down (Additional file : Table S4, S5) in different ArgS-induced pathways
  (as obtained from Reactome.org). B A pathway enrichment analysis was performed on
  O-GlcNAz-modified proteins (using the WIKIPATHWAYS database) to identify those significantly
  affected (FDR < 0.05) by ArgS. C The 363 O-GlcNAz-modified proteins identified in
  the pathway enrichment analysis B were grouped by function using the STRING database.
  D A heatmap was generated to show the log10 abundance ratio of O-GlcNAz-modified
  proteins involved in eukaryotic protein translation that were significantly changed
  (FDR < 0.05) based on proteomics analysis under the indicated conditions. The O-GlcNAz-modified
  eukaryotic factors/regulators were clustered based on their level changes relative
  to control, with samples prepared from BT-549 cells (n = 3). The cells were treated
  with an -Arg medium (or not) and GlcNAz (50 μM) for 48 h prior to collection and
  protein extraction'
