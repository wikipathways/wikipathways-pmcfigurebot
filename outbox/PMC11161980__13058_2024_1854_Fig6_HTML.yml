caption: Depletion of PC decreases oxygen consumption. A, B PCA of gene expression
  profiles of control (scram) and PC-depleted (shPC25 and shPC28) E0771 cells cultured
  in low (5.6 mM) glucose DMEM using genes contained in the “electron transport chain”
  (A) and “oxidative phosphorylation” Wikipathways (n = 3/group). C, D Hierarchical
  clustering of gene expression profiles obtained under conditions described in panels
  A and B. E–G Basal oxygen consumption rates determined by extracellular flux analysis
  of the indicated control and PC-depleted cells (n = 3–4/group). Statistical significance
  calculated using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test (E, G) or unpaired student’s
  t-test (F)
