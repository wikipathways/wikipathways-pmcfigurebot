caption: miRNA–mRNA network based on the target genes of miR-141-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-182-5p,
  and miR-661 (obtained from the Integrated Breast Cancer Pathway (Wikipathways)).
  mRNAs highlighted with yellow color targeted by one miRNA, orange color targeted
  by two miRNAs, and red color targeted by all four miRNAs. Solid and dashed lines
  represent protein–protein and miRNA–mRNA interactions, respectively (network edited
  by Cytoscape v.3.0).
