caption: Genes activated in the absence of GR-RNA binding enrich for GR and NR pathways
  or specific chromosomes. (A,B) Enrichr gene set analysis with sets of interest for
  ChEA TF targets, WikiPathways (A), and chromosome (B). Plotted are the top three
  terms in each category based on the adjusted p-value. The pathway terms are shortened
  to fit in the plot. “Activated” refers to genes uniquely activated at 1, 2, or 3 h
  of 100 nM dexamethasone treatment. The dashed gray line indicates an adjusted p-value = 0.05.
  (C) Regions of chromosomal enrichment of SoF Dex-ind. genes based on output from
  the Positional Gene Enrichment tool. Chromosomes 3, 7, and 8 are shown. Blue bars
  indicate enriched regions and their associated FDR-adjusted p-values are shown.
