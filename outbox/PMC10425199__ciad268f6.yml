caption: Three extracted subnetworks from the weighted gene coexpression network analysis
  enrichment results. Nodes represent the biological function, where edges indicate
  significant overlap of genes associated with the biological functions. Pathways
  listed are from Gene Ontology, Reactome, Wikipathways, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes. A, Subnetwork of biological pathways related to the defense response
  to bacteria. B, Subnetwork of responses related to the interaction of the host and
  symbiont cells. C, Subnetwork of cellular responses to molecules of bacterial origins.
  D, Barplot of select pathways plotted against their gProfiler P value [].
