caption: An overview of the ad-hoc map for the Kawasaki disease. The map includes
  three diagrams from two disease maps (two from the COVID-19 Disease Map (), one
  from the Asthma Map ()), 192 interactions from text mining, and 5 pathways from
  both WikiPathways and Reactome databases. See https://pathwaylab.elixir-luxembourg.org/minerva/?id=adhoc_ORPHA2331.
