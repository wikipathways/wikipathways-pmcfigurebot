caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the selected studies. A Venn diagram
  of DEGs from each study and their intersections. The genes presented are common
  to at least 4 selected studies. B Heatmap of the DEGs common to at least 4 of the
  studies. Class 1 and Class 2 correspond to microarrays and RNA-seq/single-cell studies,
  respectively. Red and blue colors represent up- and downregulated genes, respectively.
  C Bubble plot of the functional enriched pathways of the mRNA genes for each study.
  The size and color of the dots represent the number of hits and the range of the
  pathway’s p values, respectively. KEGG pathways are represented with no asterisk,
  WikiPathways with *, and pathways common to both databases are represented with
