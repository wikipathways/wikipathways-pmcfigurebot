figure_title: Cellular pathways influencing SARS-CoV-2 infection
caption: 'GSEA was performed on the screen data (). The individual genes for some
  of the top pathways are shown here. The full names of the plotted pathways are as
  follows: translation initiation, “REACTOME EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION”; negative
  rRNA regulation, “REACTOME NEGATIVE EPIGENETIC REGULATION OF RRNA EXPRESSION”; cholesterol
  biosynthesis, “REACTOME REGULATION OF CHOLESTEROL BIOSYNTHESIS BY SREBP SREBF”;
  pre-mRNA processing, “REACTOME PROCESSING OF CAPPED INTRON CONTAINING PRE MRNA”;
  cellular respiration, “WP ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN OXPHOS SYSTEM IN MITOCHONDRIA”;
  RNA Pol III transcription, “REACTOME RNA POLYMERASE III TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION
  FROM TYPE 3 PROMOTER.” Pathways are from the Reactome [] and Wikipathways [] databases.
  The data underlying this Figure can be found in .'
article_title: A genome-wide arrayed CRISPR screen identifies PLSCR1 as an intrinsic
  barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry that recent virus variants have evolved to resist.
