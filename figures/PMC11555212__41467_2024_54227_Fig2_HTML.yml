figure_title: Activation of mice and human DCs in the presence of COFs and RNA-seq
  dataset
caption: a In the presence of LPS, mouse DCs treated with COF1 with OVA expressed
  higher CD86 + , in vitro (mean ± s.d, n = 6 technical replicate; one-way ANOVA test).
  b DCs treated with COF1 with OVA had lower gMFI CD163+ in CD11c+ compared to other
  treatments, with inflammation, in vitro (mean ± s.d, n = 6 technical replicate;
  one-way ANOVA test). c High expression of CD206+ in CD11c+ in presence of COF1 with
  OVA compared to COF 5 with OVA, LPS, and soluble OVA, in vitro (mean ± s.d, n = 6
  technical replicate; one-way ANOVA test). d COF 1 with OVA increase cross-presentation
  of 257–264 SIINFEKL OVA peptide in DC, with inflammation, in vitro (mean ± s.d,
  n = 6 technical replicate; one-way ANOVA test). e Volcano plot of COF3 vs COF1,
  n = 3 biological replicate; one-way ANOVA test. COF1. f Volcano plot of COF5 vs.
  COF1, n = 3; one-way ANOVA test. g Volcano plot of COF5 vs. COF3, n = 3; one-way
  ANOVA test. h–j WikiPathways of COF3 vs. COF1, COF5 vs. COF1, COF3 vs. COF5 respectively,
  n = 3; one-way ANOVA test. k–m Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of COF3 vs. COF1, COF5
  vs. COF1, COF3 vs. COF5 respectively, n = 3 biological replicate; one-way ANOVA
  test. n Higher expression of CD86+ in human dendritic cells treated with COF1 compared
  to COF5 (in presence of soluble OVA and LPS, mean ± s.d, n = 6 biological replicate;
  one-way ANOVA test). o COF1 with LPS and soluble OVA can upregulate expression of
  CD206+ (mean ± s.d, n = 6 biological replicate; one-way ANOVA test). p An increase
  of the ratio of CD86+ gMFI to CD206+ gMFI in COF1 with ova compared to COF5 (mean ± s.d,
  n = 6 biological replicate; one-way ANOVA test). All significant differences are
  not shown for clarity.
