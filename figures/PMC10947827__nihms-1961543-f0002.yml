figure_title: NTX-301 induced transcriptome and methylome reprogramming in OC cells
caption: (A) Hierarchical clustering heatmap for DEGs (FDR<0.05) measured by RNAseq
  in OVCAR5 cells treated with NTX-301. Rows represent replicates (n=3/group). (B)
  Volcano plot of DEGs comparing OVCAR5 cells treated with NTX-301 100nM with DMSO.
  NTX-301-induced upregulated genes are shown in red and downregulated gene are shown
  in blue. (C) Dot plot of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of DEG shows the top
  sixteen KEGG pathways in OVCAR5 cells treated with NTX-301 (100nM). The size of
  the circles represents the counts of DEGs within each term, and the color of the
  circles represents statistical significance. Gene ratio (x axis) is the relative
  number of DEGs per term. (D) GSEA enrichment plots for the KEGG “fatty acid metabolism”
  gene set using the gene expression profiles of OVCAR5 cells treated with NTX-301
  (100nM) vs. DMSO (n=3). (E) WikiPathways analysis of downregulated DEGs in OVCAR5
  OC cells treated with NTX-301 (100nM) vs. DMSO shows the top significantly enriched
  molecular pathways. Gene expression was measured by RNA-seq (n=3 replicates per
  group). (F, G) Hierarchical clustering heatmap for DEGs (FDR<0.05) stemness-related
  genes (F) () and lipid metabolism (G) in OVCAR5 cells treated with NTX-301 (100nM)
  vs. DMSO. Rows represent replicates (n=3/group). (H) Volcano plot of DMPs comparing
  OVCAR5 cells treated with NTX-301 vs control. Hypermethylated CpG probes are shown
  in red (positive delta Beta) and hypomethylated CpG probes are shown in blue (negative
  delta Beta). (I) Scatter plot shows overlapping DEGs associated with promoter-associated
  DMPs in response to treatment with NTX-301 (100nM, 3days; n = 3 replicates per group).
  A total of 23,709 genes were both upregulated and were associated with hypomethylated
  CpG sites (lower right quadrant), =whereas 23,302 genes were downregulated and were
  associated with hypomethylated CpGs (lower left quadrant).
