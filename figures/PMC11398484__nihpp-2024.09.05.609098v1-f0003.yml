caption: '(A) Scatterplots comparing abundances across selected protein pairs across
  samples. (B) Distribution of rPearson based on observed (top) and permuted (bottom)
  data. Observed distribution was obtained by calculating rPearson across all possible
  protein-protein pairs. Permuted distributions were generated by randomly sampling
  50,000 protein pairs after randomly shuffling their respective timepoints 10 times
  each prior to calculating rPearson. Colors indicate strongly correlated (>=0.95;
  blue) or anticorrelated (<=−0.95; red) edges. (C) Distribution of protein edge counts
  across the trimmed correlation network. On average, each protein in the network
  participated in 174 edges. (D) Ratio of enrichment for the annotated edges in the
  correlation network (“observed network”) compared to the expected edge annotation
  frequencies across Gene Ontology biological process (GOBP), cellular component (GOCC),
  molecular function (GOMF), localization, pathways, protein-protein interactions
  (BioPlex) or protein complexes. Specifically, we calculated the enrichment for annotated
  edges as the fraction of annotated edges per category in the observed correlation
  network divided by the fraction of annotated edges among all possible edges involving
  the 5,227 proteins in the correlation network. The expected frequency of annotated
  edges was calculated by generating all possible pairs from 5,227 human proteins
  (Uniprot, 07/2024) and computing the number of pairs explained by each functional
  category. (E) Network analysis identifies known associations between proteins for
  BMP1 and RPL7A. (F-G) Network structure of the (F) 26S proteasome and (G) Citric
  Acid cycle pathway. Magenta nodes indicate known complex members annotated either
  from CORUM or EMBL ComplexPortal for protein complexes, or from BioCarta, KEGG,
  Protein Interaction Database (PID), Reactome, and WikiPathways (WP) for biochemical
  pathways. Blue edges indicate positive correlations between nodes while red edges
  indicate anticorrelations. (H-I) Cooperative proteins are highly correlated with
  members of established protein complexes including: (H) NuA4 chromatin remodeling
  complex and (I) Chaperonin-containing T (TRiC/CCT) complex. Magenta nodes indicate
  subunits of a given complex, while orange nodes indicate cooperative proteins i.e.
  proteins with correlated profiles to proteins constituting a particular protein
  complex. Cooperative node sizes indicate the negative log10 of the BH-adjusted p-value
  after computing significance from Fisher’s exact tests to determine cooperative
  association of a protein to a particular module. Blue edges indicate correlated
  edges while orange edges link cooperative proteins to members of a particular module.
  (J) Bioplex interaction network of the TRiC/CCT complex. Orange nodes are cooperative
  proteins with correlated profiles to proteins found in the TRiC/CCT complex. Gray
  edges indicate BioPlex evidence. (K) Histogram of protein complexes (x-axis) and
  their respective numbers of cooperative proteins (y-axis). (L) Heuristic to identify
  shared cooperative proteins between complexes. (M) Heatmap depicting a subset of
  shared cooperative proteins across manually curated EMBL ComplexPortal protein complexes
  namely exosomes, SWI/SNFs, ATAC remodelers, nucleosome remodelers (NuRDs), and histone
  acetyltransferase (HAT) and deacetylase (HDAC) complexes. Heatmap colored by Jaccard
  similarity coefficients calculated from overlapping sets of cooperative proteins
  between protein complex pairs and clustered using euclidean distances with average
  linkage.'
