figure_title: Pathway enrichment of most variable genes
caption: Enriched pathways in post-flight compared with pre-flight across various
  assays and missions, analysed using fast gene set enrichment analysis (fGSEA). The
  colour represents the normalized enrichment score, whereas the dot size indicates
  Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted q values. Only the pathways with unadjusted P < 0.01
  are shown. The barplot shows the total number of comparisons with q < 0.05 for every
  pathway, coloured by the direction of the enrichment. The column ‘mixed cell type’
  refers to whole blood for I4 data and lymphocyte-depleted cells for the NASA Twins
  Study. GOBP, gene ontology and biological process; GOMF, gene ontology molecular
  function; HP, human phenotype; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; NPC, neural progenitor
  cells; PID, pathway interaction database; WP, wikipathways.
