caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method was used to rank the effects of
  different biological pathways. (A) GSEA results of KEGG oxidative phosphorylation
  pathways. (B) GSEA results of Reactome respiratory chain electron transport chain.
  (C) GSEA results of the Reactome tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport
  chain of the respiratory chain. (D) GSEA results for the mitochondrial electron
  transport system in WikiPathways. (E) GSEA results for Reactome mitochondrial translation.
  (F) GSEA results for the OxPhos system of the WikiPathways mitochondrial complex
  assembly model. (G) GSEA results for the WikiPathways oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway. (H) GSEA results for KEGG glutathione metabolism. (I) GSEA results for
  KEGG lysosomes. In each figure, the blue line represents the change trend of enrichment
  scores, the vertical black line represents the position of each gene in the ordered
  dataset, while the horizontal red and blue bars show the distribution of gene sets
  in the rankings, where the red bar represents the positive contribution of enrichment
  scores and the blue bar represents the negative contribution. Enrichment score (ES),
  Normalized Enrichment Score (NES), False Discovery Rate (FDR). GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis).
