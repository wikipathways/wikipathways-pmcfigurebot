caption: Dot plot for overrepresentation analysis (ORA) based on different databases,
  analysis with Gene Ontology (GO, (A)), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG,
  (B)) and Wikipathways (C). Results are ranked according to kinase ration, and dot
  size represents involved numbers/counts of kinases. Enriched pathways are visualized
  as network plot (D). Dot size represents the number of protein-encoding genes enriched
  in each pathway. Red color represents upregulated protein levels. White color represent
  downregulated protein levels, and dot size represents involved kinases.
