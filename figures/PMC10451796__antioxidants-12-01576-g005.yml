caption: Transcriptome analysis of the effect of gRc in H2O2-treated C2C12 myotubes.
  (A) Normalized enrichment score (NES) of the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  results of H2O2 treatment compared to vehicle and the H2O2 + gRc treatment compared
  to the H2O2 treatment. The pathway terms were sourced from Gene Ontology—Biological
  Process (“Regulation of Oxidative Stress Induced Cell Death”, “Positive Regulation
  of Striated Muscle Cell Differentiation”, “ATP Synthesis Coupled Electron Transport”,
  “Muscle Cell Proliferation, Cellular Respiration”, and “Positive Regulation of Muscle
  Hypertrophy”), Gene Ontology—Cellular Component (“Mitochondrial Protein Containing
  Complex” and “Inner Mitochondrial Membrane Protein Complex”), Reactome (“Apoptosis”
  and “Myogenesis”), and WikiPathways (“Electron Transport Chain Oxphos System in
  Mitochondria”). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. (B) The selected GSEA plots of H2O2 treatment
  compared to vehicle (top) and the H2O2 + gRc treatment compared to the H2O2 treatment
  (bottom).
