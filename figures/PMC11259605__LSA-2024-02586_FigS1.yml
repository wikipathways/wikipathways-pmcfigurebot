figure_title: Extensive transcriptional deregulation in monocytes from patients with
  the reduced expression of CBX5
caption: (A) Analysis of genes up-regulated in Lo-CBX5 patients when compared to symptomatic
  controls using the KEGG database providing information about the molecular functions
  and biological pathways of genes. (B) Bar graph reporting the variation in the expression
  of the indicated genes based on RNA-seq data from SCs and Lo-Cbx5 patients. Errors
  were calculated based on the lfcSE provided by DESeq2. Levels in SCs were set at
  1. *Adj. P < 0.05, **adj. P < 0.01, ***adj. P < 0.001. (C) Analysis of genes down-regulated
  in Lo-CBX5 patients when compared to symptomatic controls using the BioPlanet or
  WikiPathways databases as indicated.
