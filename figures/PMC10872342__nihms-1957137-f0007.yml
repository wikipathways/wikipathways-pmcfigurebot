caption: 'Comparative analysis of the effect of cancer vs effect of 9S1R-NulloPT treatment,
  in mice mammary tissue: DEGs from a published study [] comparing 4T1.2-Luc TNBC
  cells originating from BALB/c mammary gland vs normal BALB/c mammary tissue (group-b).
  These were compared with the DEGs obtained from the present study of 4T1.2-Luc tumors
  treated with 9S1R-NulloPT vs untreated tumors (group-a) to differentiate the drug-induced
  changes vs cancer-induced changes on the mammary tissue. (A) 132 upregulated and
  255 downregulated genes were unique to group-a as an effect of 9S1R-NulloPT treatment,
  455 genes were commonly downregulated and 233 commonly upregulated in the two groups,
  and thus attributed to cancer-related effects. (B) Cluster analysis of the unique
  DEGs from our study (group a) emphasizes the drug-induced changes. No definite cluster
  of upregulated genes were found; however, the downregulated genes show two prominent
  clusters of Mitochondria related genes and Ribosome assembly/Translational machinery
  related genes. (C) Results from cluster analysis of the common DEGs emphasizing
  cancer induced gene expression, with focal adhesion related cluster upregulated
  and at least three distinct downregulated clusters comprising Mitochondrial Electron
  Transport Chain genes, Immune system-related genes, and Myofibril assembly genes.
  (D) Analysis of unique clusters from group-a (effect of 9S1R-NulloPT) revealed a
  list of top 10 up- and downregulated genes with Log2 fold change values (Y-axis)
  and padj scores inside the columns; a list of unique GO-terms (including biological
  processes, molecular function, cellular components) and pathways (including Kegg,
  Reactome and Wikipathways) with number of genes (X-axis) and FDR values inside columns
  for (E) Mitochondrial cluster and (F) Ribosomal cluster.'
