caption: Hypothetical ovarian cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in protogynous fishes.
  The pathway was visualized using PathVisio (https://pathvisio.org), referencing
  several fish cholesterol synthesis pathways. Gene products are represented in black
  text, while metabolites are in blue text. Gene product annotations follow Ensembl
  Zebrafish gene symbols. Red‐filled boxes represent gene products with confirmed
  upregulated expression in this study, while blue‐filled boxes denote gene products
  with downregulated expression. Open boxes represent gene products with no expression
  variation. Light green‐filled boxes represent gene products not included among the
  7289 genes but confirmed to be present in at least the three‐spot wrasse transcriptome.
  Dark gray‐filled boxes indicate gene products that could not be identified within
  the three‐spot wrasse transcriptome. Circles extending from gene products represent
  catalytic reactions, while black arrows indicate the conversion of metabolites.
  The dashed arrows indicate indirect pathways summarizing multi‐step processes.
