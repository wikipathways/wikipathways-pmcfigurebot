caption: 'Global transcriptomic characteristics of tenocytes phenotypic drift on TCP.
  A) Heatmap of gene‐level hierarchical clustering of the top 50 differentially expressed
  genes (DEG) in tendon stromal fibroblasts cultured on tissue culture plastic (TCP)
  versus vehicle control. Columns represent individual samples (N = 4 biological replicates
  from different donors). Blue denotes downregulated genes; red denotes upregulated
  genes. B) Functional annotation of S1 and S2 gene clusters in the heatmap (encompassing
  top 500 DEGs). Bar plots depict the fisher‐weighted, average correlations of the
  cluster with the annotation terms queried against MSigDB Hallmark database. C) RNA‐seq
  volcano plot of DEGs of TCP‐cultured human tenocytes relative to native tendons.
  Colored dots show the 8684 significantly expressed genes, as determined by DESeq2
  methods, with the horizontal line corresponding to an FDR ≤0.01 and vertical lines
  are at a cutoff of log2[Fold change] ± 1. D) Enriched pathways analysis of a subset
  of DEGs using Enrichr queried against BioPlanet 2019 (BP), Reactome (R), WikiPathways
  2019 (WP), and KEGG 2019 (K) Human databases. All hits had an adjusted p‐value <
  0.05. E) Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of Molecular Functions GO terms of upregulated
  and downregulated DEGs. Analysis was performed using a hypergeometric overrepresentation
  test against the GO database, with significance achieved at q‐value < 0.05. F) Bar
  plot depicts the predicted top 10 most significantly enriched transcription factors
  upstream of the DEGs. Predicted TFs are sorted by significance level (adjusted p‐value
  < 0.05). G) Top 10 kinases upstream of predicted TFs in (F) were identified using
  the Kinase Enrichment Analysis module of the Expression2Kinase pipeline. H) GSEA
  enrichment plots of some of the top differentially expressed gene sets. The plot''s
  black vertical lines represent the ranked gene hits in the gene set. The green line
  represents the normalized enrichment score (NES). The more the NES curve is skewed
  to the upper left of the plot, the more the gene set is enriched in the TCP group.
  In contrast, when the curve shifts to the lower right, this reflects a more enrichment
  in the Native Tendon control group. The red‐to‐blue colored scale at the bottom
  represents the degree of correlation of genes in the TCP group with the phenotype
  in the gene set (Red: positive correlation; blue: negative correlation) or vice
  versa for the Native Tendon control group. Note the significant regulation of gene
  set terms related to EMT, cellular proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis.
  I) GSEA enrichment plots of tendon‐specific (Top) and tendinopathy (bottom) signatures.'
