caption: Pathway enrichment of pre-cystic and cystic transcriptomic signatures. Bubbleplots
  of pathway enrichment using GO, Reactome, and WikiPathways of upregulated and downregulated
  genes from the (A) pre-cystic P70 transcriptomic signature, (B) cystic P21 transcriptomic
  signature, and (C) cystic P28 transcriptomic signature, with point size dependent
  on the number of query genes matching to each term and color dependent on the p-value.
  Treemaps display the enrichment hierarchy, using Wang similarity to reduce GO:BP
  term redundancy with parent terms consisting of largest boxes and enriched child
  terms within for each signature, and varying child terms reflecting term size for
  (D) pre-cystic P70 signature (E) cystic P21 transcriptomic signature, and (F) cystic
  P28 transcriptomic signature
