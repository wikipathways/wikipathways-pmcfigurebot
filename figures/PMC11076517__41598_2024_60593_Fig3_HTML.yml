caption: 'GO terms and pathways enriched among genes affected by C2A-2B-3-4 overexpression.
  ORA of specific GO terms (top panels) and pathways (including KEGG, Panther, Reactome
  and Wikipathways) (bottom panels) among genes upregulated (left panels) and downregulated
  (right panels) by C2A-2B-3-4 overexpression. Categories of genes are indicated at
  the left of each graph. X-axis: − log10 of p values of enrichment.'
