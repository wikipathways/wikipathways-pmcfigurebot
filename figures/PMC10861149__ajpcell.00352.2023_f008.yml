caption: Heatmaps with the top up- and downregulated pathways (based on WikiPathways,
  KEGG, and Reactome libraries) after 24 h (A), 48 h (B), 72 h (C), and 168 h (D)
  of hindlimb unloading (HU) compared with 0 h in male and female mice. Adjusted P
  value â‰¤0.05. The white boxes with X indicates that the pathway is not differentially
  expressed.
