caption: Small RNA-seq of Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 miR-210 KO or control cells under normoxia
  or hypoxia treatment. miRBase miR enrichment of (A) Cellular response to hypoxia
  (Reactome, experimental (strong)), (B) HIF1-Î± signaling pathway (GO-biological process),
  (C) hypoxia-mediated EMT and Stemness (WikiPathways), and (D) response to hypoxia
  (GO-biological process). (E) GSEA results of MiaPaca-2 and Panc-1 control cells
  under normoxia and hypoxia were obtained with KEGG pathway annotations.
