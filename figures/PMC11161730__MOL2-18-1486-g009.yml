caption: ITIH5 re‐expression in pancreatic cancer cells reduces activity of Focal
  adhesion (FA) kinases and important signaling pathways. (A) Comparison of downregulated
  tyrosine kinases in PANC‐1 and PSN‐1 ITIH5 re‐expressing cells, visualized in a
  coral tree diagram. Peptide tyrosine kinases (PTKs) downregulated in both cell lines
  are illustrated by stars. (B) Bar charts showing the top 15 downregulated PTKs in
  PANC‐1 and PSN‐1 ITIH5 re‐expressing cells. Striped columns mark PTKs related to
  focal adhesion. (C) Bar charts visualizing the significance levels of the top 10
  WikiPathways pathways based on the PTKs with significant differences in PANC‐1 and
  PSN‐1 cells re‐expressing ITIH5 compared to mock using over‐representation analysis
  (ORA). Significant levels (adjusted P‐values) are color‐coded from blue to red.
