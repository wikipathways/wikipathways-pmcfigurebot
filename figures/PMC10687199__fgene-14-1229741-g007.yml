caption: A graphical representation of the adjusted p-values in the negative log10
  scale for enriched functions obtained from various databases, including Gene Ontology
  Molecular Functions (GO:MF), Gene Ontology Cellular Components (GO:CC), Gene Ontology
  Biological Processes (GO:BP), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome
  Pathway (REAC), micro-RNA target (MIRNA), Human phenotype ontology (HP), and WikiPathways
  (WP). The enriched functions, namely, (1) nucleosome, (2) DNA packaging complex,
  and (3) structural component of chromatin, are plotted against their respective
  databases.
