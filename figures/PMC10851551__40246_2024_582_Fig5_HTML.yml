caption: Differentially expressed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA)
  networks and functional pathways. A, B Venn diagram of the differentially expressed
  lncRNAs and miRNAs, respectively. The names of lncRNAs common to at least 3 of the
  studies are shown. C, D Interaction network of common differentially expressed lncRNAs
  and miRNAs, respectively. The RNAs correspond to the nodes and their respective
  targets on the edges. E, F Bubble plot of the functional enriched pathways of lncRNA
  and miRNA targets for each study, respectively. KEGG pathways are represented with
  no asterisk and WikiPathways with *. The size and color of the dots represent the
  number of hits and the range of the pathway’s p value, respectively
