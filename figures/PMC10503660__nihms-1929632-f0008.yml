caption: ILC2s induce transcriptome changes in IL-33â€“activated eosinophils. ILC2s
  and eosinophils were cultured as in  for 24 hours, then isolated by flow cytometry
  to isolate pure cell populations from culture for RNA-Seq. Comparisons were made
  between IL-33 Act EOS cultured with or without ILC2s. (A) Top 1000 variable genes
  in hierarchical clustering heat map. (B) Parametric gene set enrichment (aka PGSEA)
  for WikiPathways. (C) MFA plot of differentially expressed genes that are FDR <
  0.05 and absolute log2-fold < 1. Representative genes are labeled in MFA plot, and
  (D) upregulated DEG genes are shown in a table. (E) DEG genes that were FDR < 0.05
  log2-fold > 1 were used to identify significant GO-enriched pathways. DEG genes
  that mapped to Reactome Immune System and Signal Transduction data sets were analyzed
  in ToppGene to identify enrichment in significant functional pathways that were
  upregulated between IL-33 Act EOS with and without ILC2s. MFA, Multifactor analysis.
