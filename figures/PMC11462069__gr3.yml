caption: 'Acetate and ACSS2 drive quiescence in HGSC models. (A) Ovcar8 cells were
  transduced with lentivirus expressing empty vector control (EV control) or HA-tagged
  ACSS2 (ACSS2 OE). ACSS2 and HA protein expression was determined by western blotting.
  β-actin was used as a loading control. Immunoblots shown are representative data
  from at least 2 independent experiments. (B) Percent proliferation relative to EV
  control was assessed after 4 days. Cell counts were assessed using the Incucyte
  Live Cell Imaging system at endpoint. Pooled data from 3 independent biological
  replicates (n = 4). Graphs represent mean ± SD. (C) Real time imaging of the proliferation
  of Ovcar8 and Kuramochi cells treated with the indicated doses of acetate. Cell
  numbers were normalized to the 0 h timepoint. Data represent 1 biological replicate
  (n = 3) of at least 3 independent experiments. (D) Summary of endpoint proliferation
  data from (C). Ovcar8: 10 mM acetate; Kuramochi: 20 mM acetate. Pooled data from
  at least 3 independent experiments (n = 3–4). (E) Proliferation as assessed by real
  time imaging. Cell numbers were normalized to the 0 h timepoint. Data represent
  1 biological replicate (n = 3) of at least 3 independent experiments. Horizontal
  dotted line indicates when media was replaced with fresh media without acetate.
  Ovcar8: 10 mM acetate; Kuramochi: 20 mM acetate. (F) Ovcar8 and Kuramochi cells
  were transduced with a modified FUCCI reporter construct and treated with acetate.
  Ovcar8: 10 mM acetate; Kuramochi: 20 mM acetate. Quiescence (cells in G0) was assessed
  by flow cytometry. Shown is the CDT1/p27 double positive G0 population normalized
  to control. Pooled data from 3 independent experiments is shown. (G–H) Ovcar8 cells
  were treated with 10 mM acetate for 72h, and RNA-Seq was performed. (G) Negatively
  enriched Wikipathways (WP), Hallmark, and KEGG gene signatures in acetate vs. control.
  (H) Heatmap of genes in a published G0 signature []. Graphs represent mean ± SD.
