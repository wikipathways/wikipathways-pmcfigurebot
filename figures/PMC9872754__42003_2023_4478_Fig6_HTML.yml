figure_title: Comparison of cell-type specific pathway enrichment in myenteric ganglia
  (MG) between porcine proximal and distal colon (p-pC, p-dC). The bubble plot shows
  the gene percentage and enrichment of WikiPathways
caption: Circle size represents the ratio of the number of cell-type pathway-specific
  differentially expressed genes (DEG) and the number of total DEG in each DEG list
  (Gene_percent). Color represents a -log10Â (FDR) distribution from big (orange) to
  small (purple). The color bars mean the specified WikiPathway classified into designated
  clusters. Up, upregulated expression. Down, downregulated expression.

  between porcine and human colonic enteric nervous system.
