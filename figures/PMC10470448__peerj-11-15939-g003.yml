figure_title: The GSEA analysis of SLC39A8-correlated DEGs between PH and NC
caption: (A) GSEA classical plots generated based on NES score in canonical Wikipathways.
  (B) The top three WikiPathways are listed respectively. (C) GSEA classical plots
  generated based on NES score in canonical Reactome pathways. (D) GSEA classical
  plots generated based on NES score in canonical KEGG pathways. P.adj < 0.05 and
  false discovery rate (FDR, qvalue) <0.25 were used to indicate significant enrichment
  score.
