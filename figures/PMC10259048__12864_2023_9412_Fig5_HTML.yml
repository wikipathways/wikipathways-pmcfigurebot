caption: Manhattan showed the natural selection signatures and enrichment analysis.
  (A) p-values of XPEHH for Zhuang and Dong people using southern Hans as the reference
  population. Positive selection signals for genes screened for the intersection of
  Fst, XPEHH and iHS. (B) Overlap among three gene lists based on gene level and shared
  term level, where purple curves link genes that belong to the same enriched ontology
  term. (C) Top 20 of the GO-BP, KEGG, Reactome Gene Sets, WikiPathways and Canonical
  Pathways. (D) Network of enriched terms coloured by cluster-ID. The respective colour
  represents its cluster identity, and the size of a node is proportional to the number
  of input genes that fall into that term. Terms with a similarity score > 0.3 are
  linked by an edge (the thickness of the edge represents the similarity score)

  neighbours in the northeastern region of the Yungui Plateau inferred from genome-wide
  variations.
