figure_title: Proteomics analysis supports diagnosis of mitochondrial disease
caption: 'Proteomics data aids in the diagnosis of an unsolved case. (A) Expression
  levels of the potential biomarkers identified in DE analysis in the 6 VUS cases.
  Blue boxplots represent the control cohort while brown boxplots indicate the patient
  cohort. Values are normalized to median intensity of control cohort in Log2 scale
  (Normalized Log2FC). Labeled dots denote the VUS cases (genes): P07 (HTRA2), P18
  (POLRMT), P19 (QRSL1), P41 (MRPS23), and P48 and P49 (COX20). (B) Mitochondrial
  ATP production rate (units/unit CS), was determined with the indicated substrate
  combinations. Boxplots represent the distribution of values for control individuals
  (n = 11, age 12–57 years) with the individual colored circle representing the value
  determined in the patient. Respiratory chain enzyme activities of complex I, complexes
  I + III, complex II, complexes II + III, and complex IV were determined in isolated
  mitochondria and adjusted to CS activity. Results are presented as percentage of
  mean control values with boxplots representing the distribution of values for control
  individuals (n = 15–42; age 5–70 years) and the individual colored circle representing
  the value determined in the patient. (C) BN-PAGE of mitochondria isolated from muscle
  from patient (P41) and a control individual. Enzyme complexes I–IV (CI–IV) were
  detected by Western blot with appropriate antibodies. (D) Western blot analysis
  of patient and control fibroblasts. HSC70 (heat shock protein family A[Hsp70] member
  8) was used as loading control and protein signal was determined as described with
  appropriate antibodies. (E) Volcano plot of total proteomes for P41 (n = 1) versus
  controls (n = 17). Up or downregulated proteins (Log2FC > 2.5 or Log2FC < –2.5)
  are shown in red (increased) and blue (decreased), respectively. MRPS23 protein
  is labeled in orange. Average Log2 Intensities calculated from individual intensities
  of the entire dataset (patient and controls). (F) Volcano plot from E with mitochondrial
  ribosomal proteins emphasized in purple. (G) Volcano plot of GSEA analysis of P41
  DE results, circle diameter denotes set size while color denotes annotation source
  (blue, GO:BP; red, Reactome; green, WikiPathways). Differentially enriched gene
  sets are labeled according to a normalized enrichment score (NES) > 1.3 or < –1.3
  and a q < 0.05 (presented as –Log10q value).'
