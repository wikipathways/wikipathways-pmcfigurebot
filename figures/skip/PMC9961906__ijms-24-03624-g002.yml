caption: 'TFIIIC binds close to promoters of stem cells genes and neuronal genes.
  (A) Average levels and heatmap for H3K18ac, TFIIIC, p300 and H3K27ac in H9 hESCs.
  The panels on top of the heatmaps show the enrichment of the indicated factors at
  TFIIIC peaks, as seen in the corresponding heatmaps (medium panels). Note that H3K18ac
  and H3K27ac loci positive for TFIIIC are devoid of p300. The lower panels are heatmaps
  showing the enrichment of the indicated factors for a random set of peaks. (B) g:Profiler
  analysis [] of TFIIIC peaks in H9 hESCs, showing GO terms enriched for cellular
  components and Wikipathways. The p-value for enrichment is shown as a color code.
  (C) Genome browser examples of H3K18as and H3K27ac peaks in H9 hESCs, NECs and IMR90
  fibroblasts: stem cell-associated genes such as CHD1, HELLS, KLF4 and the fibroblast-expressed
  marker COL6A3 gene are shown. These stem cell loci are devoid of p300 but associated
  with TFIIIC in H9 hESCs (the grey bars indicate TFIIIC peaks within the promoter
  regions of these genes). In contrast, COL6A3 is associated with p300/CBP in IMR90
  cells. At the promoters of KLF4 and HELLS, the TFIIIC peaks are also visible in
  serum-starved IMR90 cells (â€“S). (D,E) GIGGLE score analysis for all TFIIIC peaks
  (D) and TFIIIC peaks overlapping H3K18ac peaks (E) in hESCs [].'
