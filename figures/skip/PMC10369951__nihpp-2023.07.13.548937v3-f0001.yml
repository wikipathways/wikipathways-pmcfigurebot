figure_title: Aβ drives proteome-wide protein insolubility that resembles normal aging
caption: 'A. Schematic of experimental procedure. B. Total insoluble protein Intensity
  in worms expressing Aβ vs genotype control strain CL2122, all values normalized
  to the average of the control in each experiment n = 4, error bars = SEM, Mann-Whitney
  Test. C. Representative volcano plot from one experiment Absolute Log2(Fold Change)>0.58,
  Q <0.01 D. Barplot of selected enriched GO terms, KEGG pathways and Wikipathways
  in the Aβ insoluble proteome, Benjamini Hochberg FDR <5% (see  for complete list)
  E. STRING protein-protein interaction network of insoluble proteins with annotations
  for “Determination of Lifespan”, average fold change and Q values across both experiments,
  STRING p < 1x10−16. F. left: F. Overlap of proteins enriched in the insoluble proteome
  of old C. elegans from two publicly available datasets, p<0.0001 Fischer’s Exact
  Test. right: Overlap of aging insoluble proteome with Aβ insoluble proteome, p<0.0001
  Fischer’s Exact Test. G. Overlap of all GO annotations from the aging insoluble
  proteome and Aβ insoluble proteome, p<0.0001 Fischer’s Exact Test.'
