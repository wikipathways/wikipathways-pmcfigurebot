caption: Signatures of transcriptomic remodeling unique to Colombian- and Y-infections.
  ‘WikiPathways’ (A) and 'Biological Process gene ontology Terms’ (B), enriched by
  the genes uniquely upregulated at 24-h post-infection in Colombian- and Y-infected
  cardiomyocytes are sorted based on P-value. Bar lengths represent enrichment Z-scores
article_title: Differential cardiomyocyte transcriptomic remodeling during in vitro
  Trypanosoma cruzi infection using laboratory strains provides implications on pathogenic
  host responses.
