caption: 'Analysis of the composition and functional networks of miRNAs present in
  hiPS-EVs. EVs were isolated from 3 iPSC lines cultured in different oxygen conditions:
  N-normoxia (21% O2); H5 — hypoxia 5% O2; H3 — hypoxia 3% O2. A Percentage of the
  12 most abundant miRNAs in EVs based on miRNA-seq analysis (n = 3). B Comparison
  of the content of individual miRNAs from the Top 12 miRNAs in hiPS-EVs (n = 3).
  C Heatmap of KEGG pathways for the miR-302 cluster generated by the mirPath v.3
  software (DIANA Tools). WIKIPathways analysis of target genes for miR-302 cluster
  (D) and miRNA-gene network with depicted genes from TGFβ pathway (TGFBR2, PFN, CFN)
  (E) generated by the Mienturnet web tool. F Gene ontology (GO) terms (biological
  process, cellular component, and molecular function) for hsa-miR-302b-3p target
  genes created with the mirPath v.3 software. TF – transcription factor. All data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance was calculated in R using
  t-test (B). *p < 0.05'
