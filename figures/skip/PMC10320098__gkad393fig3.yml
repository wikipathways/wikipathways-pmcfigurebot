caption: 'Enriched terms for the diabetic nephropathy case study. 148 genes that are
  down-regulated in advanced stage DN compared with early stage were submitted to
  Enrichr-KG with the selected gene set libraries: KEGG pathways, WikiPathways and
  LINCS L1000 consensus chemical perturbations. Genes appear as green nodes, WikiPathways
  pathways are pink nodes, KEGG pathways are in light purple, and LINCS L1000 compounds
  are in turquoise and light blue. Small molecules that up regulate a gene are linked
  to the gene via a red link, and those that down-regulate the genes are in blue.Â The
  query can be accessed via the following URL: https://maayanlab.cloud/turl/d9e0a6f3.'
