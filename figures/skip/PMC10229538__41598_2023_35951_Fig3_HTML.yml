caption: Network diagram of the main intracellular processes affected. Genes involved
  in different intracellular processes are shown as rectangles in red (upregulated)
  or blue (downregulated) according to their expression from RNA-Seq profiles under
  different conditions, insulin 100 nM for 2 h or aggregated LDL 100 µg/mL for 8 h.
  Conditions are displayed at the top of each rectangle as black (insulin) or white
  (aggLDL) squares. The network was manually adjusted to show the main genes obtained
  in the unsupervised GO enrichment and WikiPathways analysis.
