caption: 'Molecular determinants of anti-CXCR3 autoantibodies identified by a machine
  learning approach. (A) Importance and direction of association of proteins selected
  by regularized regression. Proteins selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection
  operator graded according to variable importance (i.e. lambda ratio) and direction
  of association. Fractional polynomials were applied to account for non-linear relationships.
  Mixed association describes that transformation factors and direction do not indicate
  a negative nor positive association. The model yielded a coefficient of variation
  (R2) of 0.053 (10-fold cross-validated R2: 0.025). (B) Protein–protein interaction
  network comprising selected proteins. Depicted is the protein–protein interaction
  network based on protein–protein interaction enrichment analysis conducted with
  Metascape. STRING, BioGrid, OmniPath, and InWeb_IM constituted the databases used
  for analysis. Molecular Complex Detection algorithm was applied and identified cytokine–cytokine
  interaction (GO term hsa04060) as functional cluster. Finally, the network was modeled
  with Cytoscape. Proteins related to this cluster are marked in green. Dot size reflects
  number of protein–protein interactions, and circle color identifies direction of
  association. Date of Metascape query: 28 April 2022. (C) Pathway and process enrichment
  analysis. Presented are the results of pathway and process enrichment analysis conducted
  with Metascape using KEGG Pathway, GO Biological Processes, Reactome Gene Sets,
  Canonical Pathways, Cell Type Signatures, CORUM, TRRUST, DisGeNET, PaGenBase, Transcription
  Factor Targets, WikiPathways, PANTHER Pathway, and COVID as ontology sources. Input
  variables were the proteins selected by regularized regression. P-values were calculated
  based on the accumulative hypergeometric distribution. Date of Metascape query:
  28 April 2022. A full legend of protein names is provided in   . aAbs, autoantibodies.'
