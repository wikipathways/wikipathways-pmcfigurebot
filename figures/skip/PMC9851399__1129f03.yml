caption: Loss of Gata4 down-regulates lipid metabolism pathways in fasting and in
  feeding conditions. RNA-seq of Gata4LKO and control liver samples fasted for 12
  h or refed for 12 h with HS diet after 12 h fasting. (A) Bioplanet pathway enrichment
  analysis of down-regulated genes in refed Gata4LKO liver RNA-seq compared with refed
  control livers. (B) Heat map of the expression of selected genes involved in the
  indicated metabolic processes, which are down-regulated in fasted or refed Gata4LKO
  livers compared with their respective controls. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of down-regulated genes in Gata4LKO livers in only the fasted or refed conditions
  or in both. (D,E) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the GO biological pathway
  cholesterol efflux pathway (D) and the Wikipathways glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
  gene set (E) among all expressed genes ranked for their fold change and P-value
  in Gata4LKO versus control livers in the refed condition.
