figure_title: Population RNAseq of intestinal lymphocytes from recipients of Cd160−/−
  or wildtype cells
caption: '(A) Comparison of Cd160−/− T cells with matched controls resulted in the
  detection of 216 differentially expressed genes. (B) Results from gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) performed on the comparison from panel (A). Notable and significant
  (adjusted p-value < .05) results shown from tests on pathways from MSigDB, WikiPathways,
  and Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium. (C) Protein expression of CD62L (left: frequency,
  right: MFI) on colonic CD4+ T cells. (D) Gene expression of CD62L (encoded by Sell)
  in colonic CD4+ T cells. (E) Heatmap depicting 216 differentially expressed genes
  in Cd160−/− vs. wildtype colonic CD4+ T cells. Genes of particular interest are
  indicated. Columns represent individual animals. (F) Signature scores computed using
  the genes distinguishing LPL cluster 9 from other clusters (as in ) and evaluated
  on population RNAseq samples separate the Cd160−/− samples from control samples
  (p = 0.092, adjusted for additional comparisons involving the LPL-2 and LPL-7 cluster
  signatures). (G) A signature created from the Cd160−/− vs. wildtype comparison was
  used to score lamina propria lymphocytes from the single-cell results (). LPL-9
  cluster exhibited a lower score than in the remainder of cell clusters (p < .001,
  t test). In panels (C-D) mean ± s.e.m are shown and data points represent individual
  animals. t-test was used. Statistical analysis for panels (F-G), see . See also
