figure_title: Pathway analysis of total brain CD45+ cells during S. aureus craniotomy
  infection
caption: The heat map depicts significantly enriched pathways using the total events
  (dsRed+ and dsRedâˆ’) of each cluster compared to all other populations. Significance
  of the normalized enrichment scores (NES) for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  is denoted (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; and ****, p < 0.0001). H=
  Hallmark pathway; R= Reactome pathway; WP= WikiPathways.

  a critical role for reactive oxygen species in biofilm containment during Staphylococcus
  aureus craniotomy infection.
