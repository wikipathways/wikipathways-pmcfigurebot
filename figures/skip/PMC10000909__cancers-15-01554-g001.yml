caption: Bioinformatics analysis of circRNAs in CLL samples. (A) Heatmap demonstration
  of 52 differentially expressed circRNAs between CLL lymphocytes (red bar, right)
  and normal B-cells (blue bar, left). (B) Volcano plotting of deregulated circRNAs
  in CLL samples. (C) Interaction analysis between candidate circRNAs and other signaling
  mediators. (D) Gene ontology (GO) biological process and (E) WikiPathways enrichment
  analysis of gene networks. (F) Drug sensitivity prediction of gene networks in CLL.
