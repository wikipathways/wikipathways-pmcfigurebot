caption: Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
  (a) Classification of the DEGs based on their functional annotation, biological
  processes, cellular locations, and molecular functions. The top 10 sub-categories
  based on the number DEGs in each category are represented in each graph. (b) Biological
  pathway classification of DEGs. The DEGs were grouped in different pathways on the
  basis of the information gathered from different online pathways sources, including
  KEGG, Wikipathways, and/or Reactome. Each bar shows the number of genes associated
  with the subsequent pathway. (c) Overlapping genes in multiple pathways. The red
  bars display up-regulated, while the green bars show down-regulated genes.
