caption: We designed a literature search term to identify research articles that would
  provide information on orexin receptor signaling. The search term “OREXIN” OR “HYPOCRETIN”
  OR “HCRT” OR “OX” OR “NRCLP1” OR “PPOX” OR “HCRT1” OR “HCRT2” OR “HYPOCRETIN1” OR
  “HYPOCRETIN2” OR “OX1” OR “OX2” OR “OREXIN1” OR “OREXIN2” OR “OX1R” OR “OX2R” OR
  “HCRTR1” OR “HCRTR2” OR “OREXIN 1 RECEPTOR” OR “OREXIN 2 RECEPTOR” OR"HYPOCRETIN
  1 RECEPTOR” OR “HYPOCRETIN 2 RECEPTOR” AND (“SIGNALING” OR “PATHWAY” OR “SIGNALLING”)
  yielded 5,548 PubMed articles, among which 125 articles were selected for manual
  curation of reactions based on the NetPath annotation criteria described in (Kandasamy
  et al. , ). We identified a total of 318 downstream signaling reactions, which include,
  23 transport, 31 catalysis events (post-translational modifications), 15 molecular
  associations, 23 activation/inhibition reactions and a total of 226 gene regulation
  events comprising 56 reactions reported at protein and 170 reactions at mRNA level.
  A compendium of these annotated reactions is represented as a systematic pathway
  map in Fig. . This pathway map was generated on the standalone free pathway drawing
  tool, PathVisio (van Iersel et al. ) and is made freely accessible on https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5094.
  The data pertaining to the pathway is presented in a standard community exchange
  format, Biological PAthway eXchange (BioPAX) (Demir et al. ) Level 3 (OWL). The
  entire data can be downloaded in .png, .pdf and .svg image formats as well as in
  .txt format from the WikiPathways (Pico et al. ; Kelder et al. ). A supplementary
  table (Supplementary Table S1) provides all the annotated reactions with a brief
  description of each.
