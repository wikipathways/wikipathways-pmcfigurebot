caption: 'Oxaliplatin-induced differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways
  in DRG. (A) Top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with vehicle only (vehicle
  + vehicle = VV) as base, compared with oxaliplatin-only (oxaliplatin + vehicle)
  treatment. Downregulated (blue) and upregulated (red) DEGs are shown. FDR <0.05,
  logFC > 0.38 (fold change greater than 1.5). (B) Enrichment analysis of OX-treated
  DRG (Metascape) using ontology sources: GO Biological Processes, KEGG Pathway, Reactome
  Gene Sets, CORUM, PaGenBase, WikiPathways, and PANTHER Pathway. Log10(P) is the
  P value in log base 10. (C) Enrichment analysis of OX-treated DRG by TRRUST (Transcriptional
  Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence â€“ based Text mining (https://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/).
