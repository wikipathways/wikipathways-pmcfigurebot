caption: Characteristics of the KE annotation. (a) Stacked bar plot representing the
  proportion of annotation types by KE level. Total height of the bar reflects the
  number of KEs in each level of biological organisation. Dark brown (no annotation)
  stack corresponds to the number of KEs with no associated gene sets, while the different
  annotation types are represented proportionally to their use in each level. HPO = Human
  Phenotype Ontology, WP = WikiPathways, GO_BP = Gene Ontology Biological Process,
  GO_CC = Gene Ontology Cellular Component, GO_MF = Gene Ontology Molecular Function.
  (b) The density distribution of the number of KEs associated with each gene. Median
  of the distribution is indicated with a dashed brown line and the rug below x-axis
  is used to support the interpretation of the distribution. (c) Number of different
  tissues/organs (turquoise) and cell types (dark green) under each system-level annotation.
  (d) Total number of KEs by system level annotation. The system “other” includes
  KEs assigned a cell type applicable for a range of tissues and/or systems, and those
  for which no system could be defined.
