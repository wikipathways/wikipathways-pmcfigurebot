caption: Identification, biological function and pathway enrichment analyses of DEPs.
  (A and B) Volcano plots of DEPs from control vs. DOX (A) and SGI vs. DOX (B). The
  point (blue) on the left is the protein with a downregulated expression, and the
  point (red) on the right is the protein with an upregulated expression. Each point
  in the figure represents a specific protein. (C) A heatmap analysis of 222 DEPs.
  (D) Chord diagram showing the top 10 enriched WikiPathways. The different colors
  represent the different categories to which they belong, and the color map represents
  fold change of proteins (log2FC).
