caption: PolyAMiner-Bulk analysis of bulk RNA-seq dataset of post-mortem prefrontal
  cortexes of four control and four AD patients from the ROSMAP data consortium. (A)
  Volcano plot of differentially expressed core APA factors. (B) Volcano plot of differential
  APA genes. (C, left) Representative differential APA gene with a positive PolyAIndex,
  suggesting 3’UTR elongation. (C, right) Representative differential APA gene with
  a negative PolyAIndex, suggesting 3’UTR shortening. (D) WikiPathways over representation
  analysis of 3’UTR shortening and lengthening differential APA genes. (E) Representative
  enriched signaling pathway.
