figure_title: Silencing of KDM6A is linked to enrichment of TGF-β signature and cell
  migration and invasion pathways in MCF10A cells
caption: (A). Western blotting showing KDM6A expression in a single clone. sgCtrl,
  non-targeted sgRNA control; sgKDM6A, sgRNA targeting KDM6A. (B). Volcano plot showing
  significant upregulation of 599 genes and downregulation of 547 genes after silencing
  of KDM6A in MCF10A cells. Cut-off value for expression at X-axis is log2 Fold_change
  (sgKDM6A vs. sgCtrl) ≤ −0.58 or log2 Fold_change (sgKDM6A vs. sgCtrl) ≥ 0.58. For
  the Y-axis, the cut-off value is −log10FDR >1. (C). Gene ontology (GO), KEGG, Wikipathways
  and NetPath pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes from KDM6A-silenced
  vs. non-targeted control. (D). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) shows significantly
  enriched gene expression signatures in MCF10A cells after silencing of KDM6A. NES,
  normalized enrichment score. Statistical significance is shown by p value. (E).
  Expression levels of featuring genes involved in tight junction, ETS (erythroblast
  transformation-specific), TGF-β signaling, metastasis and inflammation. Expression
  level is indicated with log2FPKM(Fold_change) ± S.D.; n=2.
