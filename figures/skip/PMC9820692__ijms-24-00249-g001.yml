caption: 'Breast cancer cells undergo both apoptosis and ferroptosis upon nutrient
  restriction. (a,b) Functional enrichment analysis of microarray data (GSE121378)
  using Cytoscape software. Wikipathways of the top 200 up-regulated (a) and down-regulated
  (b) genes (FC > 1.5, FC < 0.5; p < 0.05) are reported. (c) Percentage of dead breast
  cancer cells after 24 h nutrient restriction (NR: HBSS, 1 g/L glucose, 1% FBS) with
  or without 1 h pre-treatment with 5 μM ferrostatin-1 (FST-1). (d,e) Western blot
  analysis of pH2AX, p53, and PARP-1 on MCF7 cells treated with NR. Actin was used
  as loading control. Immunoblots reported are representative of three independent
  experiments yielding similar results. (f) RT-qPCR analysis of the mRNA expression
  of p53 downstream genes BAX, PUMA, CDKN1. (g) Percentage of dead breast cancer cells
  after 24 h NR with or without 1 h pre-treatment with 10 μM z-VAD-fmk (zVAD) and
  5 μM FST-1. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 3; **** p < 0.0001, ** p < 0.01,
  * p < 0.05, vs. CTR; ° p < 0.05, °°° p < 0.001 vs. NR; ###p < 0.001 vs. NR and NR
  + zVAD).'
