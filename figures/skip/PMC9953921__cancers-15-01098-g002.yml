caption: Differential gene expression between KRASmut and KRASwt with a p-value <
  0.05. (A) Heatmap for 92 DEGs of KRASmut (rows) from the NanoString PanCancer progression
  panel are clustered by statistically significant downregulation (blue) and up regulation
  (red) between KRASmut and KRASwt (column). The consensus molecular subtypes 1–4
  (CMS1–4) were also clustered (column). Blue to red denotes gene expression, with
  blue implying low gene expression and red implying high gene expression. (B) Top
  five pathways of BioPlanet and WikiPathways database sources enriched by DEGs with
  their FDR values. (C) The IPA graphical summary of 92 statistically significant
  DEG of KRASmut. (D) The IPA upstream regulator analysis reveal that TGFBR1 is the
  upstream regulator associated with lymphocyte cell death.
