caption: Common genes-based GO and pathway analysis sorted by adjusted p-values. Enriched
  genes are marked. (A–C) GO terms analysis results were shown, including biological
  process, cellular component and molecular function. (D–F) Pathway analysis results
  were identified by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), WikiPathways
  and Reactome.
