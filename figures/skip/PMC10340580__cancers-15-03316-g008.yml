caption: 'Enrichment pathway analysis of genes with SNVs that were significantly correlated
  to 16S rRNA transcripts in HGSC and EEC. (A) Significantly enriched WikiPathways
  for the genes with differential SNVs in the HGSC database, with predominance of
  ciliary physiology, immune response to infection, including to E. coli, and signaling
  pathways. (B) Significantly enriched WikiPathways for the genes with differential
  SNVs in the EEC database, also with predominance of immune response to infection,
  including to E. coli, lipid metabolism, and signaling pathways. ID: WikiPathways
  ID (WP and number); p-value: significant FDR-adjusted p-values < 0.05; geneID: symbols
  of genes correlated with 16S rRNA transcripts that are located in specified pathways.'
