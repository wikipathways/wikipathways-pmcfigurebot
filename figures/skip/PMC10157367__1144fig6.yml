caption: Evaluation of M+2+6− cells in scRNA-seq datasets of DLBCL. A, Uniform Manifold
  Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of malignant B cells from the Roider and Steen
  cohorts. B, Proportion of subpopulations across samples and annotation of M+2+6−
  cells in UMAP. C, Correlation of genes enriched in the M+2+6− subpopulation as evaluated
  by scRNA-seq with hits from the bulk GEP cohorts (). CCND2 is highlighted and is
  among the concordant hits (see also Supplementary Table S13). D, WikiPathways terms
  enrichment among genes positively associated with M+2+6− cells. Both axes in C and
  D are scaled exponentially for clarity (see also Supplementary Table S14).
