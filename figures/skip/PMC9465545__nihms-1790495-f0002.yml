figure_title: FUS::DDIT3-mediated sequestration of CEBPB from the genome inhibits
  BAF complex activity over CEBPB target sites and attenuates adipogenic gene activation
caption: A. Venn diagram reflecting CEBPB MACS-called peaks in shSCR and shDDIT3 conditions
  in MLPS-1765-92. B. CEBPB occupancy at sites that retain, gain, or lose SMARCC1
  occupancy in shSCR and shDDIT3 conditions C. Venn diagram reflecting overlap of
  gained CEBPB and SMARCC1 sites upon FUS::DDIT3 knockdown. D. Heatmap of CEBPB, SMARCC1,
  H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq peaks over sites that dually gain CEBPB and SMARCC1 upon FUS::DDIT3
  knockdown. E. (left) Immunoblots reflecting total nuclear BAF complex subunit, DDIT3,
  CEBPB, and GAPDH control levels in MLS-1765-92 cells treated with either shSCR or
  shDDIT3. (right) Bar graph indicating GAPDH-normalized densitometry of CEBPB immunoblots
  (n=3 experimental replicates). F. Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs), with those near dually-gained sites marked in red (upregulated) and blue
  (downregulated). G. Gene ontology analysis of upregulated genes that are near dually-gained
  sites across WikiPathways genesets (WP=WikiPathways). H. Z-score heatmap of genes
  associated with gene ontology terms related to development, differentiation, and
  apoptosis that are upregulated and near dually-gained sites upon knockdown. Gene
  names in red are represented in track examples in (I). I. Tracks and RPKM gene expression
  bar graphs for upregulated genes near dually-gained sites upon FUS::DDIT3 knockdown
  (FOXO3, SOD2, LPIN1, DMD, AEBP1, IRS1). See also .
