figure_title: Microglial and leukocyte clusters are typified by unique transcriptional
  pathways during S. aureus craniotomy infection
caption: Pathways that were differentially expressed in (A) microglia, (B), monocyte/macrophage,
  and (C) granulocyte clusters in the brain using total events (dsRed+ and dsRedâˆ’)
  identified by scRNA-seq. Significance of the normalized enrichment scores (NES)
  for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is denoted (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***,
  p < 0.001; and ****, p < 0.0001). H= Hallmark pathway; R= Reactome pathway; WP=
  WikiPathways.
