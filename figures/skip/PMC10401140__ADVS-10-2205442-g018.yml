caption: DEPF architecture. i) Multiple low‐dimensional representations of scRNA‐seq
  data generated by unsupervised methods. ii) The bi‐objective function constructed
  by an indicator, the mean intra‐cluster distance and the sum of the cell‐to‐center
  distance for each cell. iii) Ensemble pruning process of a bio‐objective fruit fly
  optimization algorithm. iv) Diverse functional genomic analyses including gene ontology
  enrichment analysis, WikiPathways analysis, protein–protein interaction network
  analysis, transcription factor‐gene interaction analysis, miRNA‐gene interaction
  analysis, protein‐drug interaction and disease‐gene association analysis.
