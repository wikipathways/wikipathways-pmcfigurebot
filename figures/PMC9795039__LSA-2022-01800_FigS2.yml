figure_title: Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis performed against all preys identified
  as high-confidence proximal interactors for kindlin2 bait in the proximity-dependent
  biotinylation labeling
caption: 'GO enrichment was analyzed for three GO ontologies: Biological Process (BP),
  Cellular Compartment (CC), and Molecular Function (MF); for three biological pathways:
  KEGG, Reactome (REAC), and WikiPathways (WP); for two regulatory motifs in DNA:
  TRANSFAC (TF) and miRTarBase (miRNA); for two protein databases: Human Protein Atlas
  (HPA) and CORUM; and for a Human Phenotype Ontology (HP). These analyses were performed
  using g:Profiler as described in the Materials and Methods section.'
