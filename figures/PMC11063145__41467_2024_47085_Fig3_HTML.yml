figure_title: Transcriptomic analyses of differentially expressed genes in H and AC
  iHLCs
caption: A Integrative analysis of differentially expressed genes for the Wikipathways
  gene set was performed using PIANO (Bioconductor). The most statistically significant
  downregulated pathways (blue) associated with metabolism and cell fate. B Wikipathways
  gene set analyses of upregulated pathways (red) associated with metabolism and cell
  fate. C Analyses of differentially expressed genes for KEGG pathways using the COLOR
  feature. Several genes associated with lipid pathways (red) were upregulated. D
  KEGG COLOR analyses highlighted multiple genes interacting with oxidative phosphorylation
  that were downregulated(blue), predicting lower NAD and ATP (blue). E KEGG COLOR
  analyses also highlighted the electron transport chain in which several genes interacting
  with mitochondrial complexes were downregulated (blue) in AC.
