caption: Altered expression of PPAR and electron transport chain-associated genes
  in mutant mouse liver. (A) WikiPathways gene set enrichment analysis. (B, C) Heat
  map of significantly changed genes in electron transport chain (B) and PPAR-signaling
  (C) pathways. (D) Confirmatory qRT-PCR of Fgf21, Hnf4a and Ppargc1a of the same
  samples. (E) Plasma levels of Fgf21 measured from ad libitum–fed and overnight-fasted
  mice. Males and females analyzed together since no sex differences were identified.
  For all, each data point represents a single mouse, aged 5 months. (F) Heat map
  of significantly changed genes encoding fatty acid degradation proteins. (G–I) Confirmatory
  qRT-PCR of fatty acid oxidation genes (G), rate limiting genes of gluconeogenesis
  (Pck1) and glycolysis (Pklr) (H) and ketone body synthesis (I). All samples derived
  from RNA from liver tissue of 9 Mmut-ki/wt and 10 Mmut-ko/ki 4-month-old male mice
  in the ad libitum–fed state. All P-values determined by the Wilcoxon rank test.
