caption: (a) COBLL1 expression in subcutaneous and visceral AMSCs throughout adipogenic
  differentiation, N = 4 biologically independent experiments, t-test two-sided, data
  represent median + 95% CI. (b) COBLL1 gene expression enrichment across 142 tissues
  (A-D) from enrichment profiler36. COBLL1 probes 203641_s_at and 203642_s_at were
  used for coregulation analysis (E-F). (c) Correlation with COBLL1 probe ILMN_1761260
  using microarray data from lean and individuals with obesity. (d) Enrichment of
  pathways in the HCI (upper panel) and WikiPathways (lower panel) gene set lists
  from Enrichr, plotted as in  (KEGG), with p-value thresholds corresponding to the
  FDR cutoffs in those data. p-values are derived from a hypergeometric test. (e)
  COBLL1 expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue before and after a very low caloric
  diet (VLCD, upper panel, n = 18), corresponding body weight (lower panel), Wilcoxon
  signed-rank test.
