caption: Differential transcriptional expression between Asymptomatic cases infected
  with VOC or wildtype SARS-CoV-2. (A) Principal component analysis helps to visualize
  the clustering of COVID-19 Asymptomatic cases infected with wildtype, or VOC (n = 5)
  strains. (B) A barplot depicts the hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) as Upregulated (red) or Downregulated (green) between individuals infected
  with VOC as compared with VOC. (C) A volcano plot of DEGs between infection with
  VOC or wt infections. The x-axis is labelled by fold change and y-axis shows –log10(p-value),
  the red dot depicts up-regulated genes and blue represents downregulated genes.
  (D) GSE of Biological processes run on the DEGs. (E) GSE WikiPathways analysis is
  depicted. Pathways details are displayed on the y-axis and gene ratio is plotted
  on x-axis. The greater the size of circle the greater the number of genes involved
  in a pathway; the circles are colored based on p-adjusted value.
