caption: (A) Detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the left atrium
  of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF-LA) compared with patients with sinus rhythm
  (Sinus-LA) using a volcano plot showing fold changes (AF-LA/Sinus-LA gene expression)
  relative to the P value of the comparison. In this figure, the filter criterion
  is P<0.05. All false discovery rate-corrected P values <0.2. Red dots indicate upregulated
  genes; green dots indicate downregulated genes; and gray dots indicate the genes
  that did not pass the filter criterion. (B) The Transcriptome Analysis Console was
  used to summarize those upregulated (red) and downregulated (green) genes in WikiPathways.
  The summary image is based on the original images for “Senescence and autophagy
  in cancer (Homo sapiens)” (B) and “Autophagy (Homo sapiens)” (C) in WikiPathways.
