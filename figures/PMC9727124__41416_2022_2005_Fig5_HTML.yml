caption: 'a Second cohort immune microenvironment description based on combined RNA
  sequencing and IHC analyses. b Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of IIH-FH and IIL-FL
  groups according to FDR < 5% (q-value: <0.05). Green: pathways enriched in IIL-FL.
  Burgundy: pathways enriched in the IIH-FH. c Volcano plot showing differential gene
  expression analysis between IIH-FH and IIL-FL groups. d Gene Ontology biological
  process enrichment analysis of the 626 differentially expressed genes recognised
  between IIH-FH and IIL-FL groups. e Functional enrichment analysis (WikiPathways)
  of the 626 differentially expressed genes recognised between the IIH-FH and IIL-FL
  groups.'
