figure_title: Preferential enrichment for genes associated with functions of myenteric
  and inner submucosal ganglia (MG, ISG) in porcine proximal or distal colon (p-pC,
  p-dC)
caption: Comparison of pathway enrichment between MG and ISG in p-dC  or p-dC a, b,
  and in MG or in ISG between p-pC and p-dC c, d. The bubble plots show the gene percentage
  and enrichment of WikiPathways. Circle size represents the ratio of the number of
  pathway-specific differentially expressed genes (DEG) and the number of total DEG
  in each DEG list (Gene_percent). Color represents a -log10(FDR) distribution from
  big (orange) to small (purple). The color bars mean the specified WikiPathways classified
  into designated clusters. Up, upregulated expression. Down, downregulated expression.

  between porcine and human colonic enteric nervous system.
