caption: Analysis of necroptosis-related genes in HCC using single-cell and bulk RNA
  sequencing data.(A) Distribution of 55,023 cells across 13 cell types in the HCC
  single-cell RNA (scRNA) dataset. (B) Assessment of necroptosis scores in single-cell
  RNA data using the AddModuleScore method. (C) Boxplot illustrating variations in
  necroptosis scores across 13 cell types. (D) Expression profiles of necroptosis
  genes in the scRNA dataset. (E) Necroptosis score expression in various cancer cell
  clusters from the scRNA dataset. (F) Differential gene expression between cluster
  1 and other clusters in cancer cells. (G) Venn diagram (VeenPlot) showing the overlap
  of 168 DEGs among scRNA DEGs, ICGC-LIHC, and GEO14520 datasets. (H) Expression of
  125 DEGs between normal and tumor samples in the TCGA-LIHC cohort. (I) Gene Ontology
  Biological Process (GO-BP), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and
  WikiPathways analysis for the 125 DEGs, comparing high and low necroptosis-related
  scores.
