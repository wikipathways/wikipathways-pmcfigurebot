caption: Several crucial signaling pathways are associated with the increase or decrease
  in expression of genes. (A) The Venn diagram was constructed by integrating three
  signaling pathway databases, namely KEGG, Reactome, Bioplanet, and WikiPathways.
  Additionally, it was observed that some signaling pathways exhibited a correlation
  with the upregulation or downregulation of certain genes. Furthermore, the genes
  implicated in major signaling pathways in sperm were also identified. A Venn diagram
  was created by integrating three signaling pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome, BioPlanet,
  and WikiPathways). (B) Certain signaling pathways were found to be associated with
  genes that were either up-regulated or downregulated. Genes implicated in key signaling
  pathways were identified in Sertoli cells.
