caption: MetaboAnalyst enrichment analysis conducted using RaMP consisting of HMDB,
  KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways simultaneously. Only upregulated metabolites underwent
  enrichment analysis due to the low numbers of downregulated metabolites (<5 during
  both peak allergy season and off-peak season). (A) Upregulated metabolites in PA
  vs. PHCs; (B) upregulated metabolites in OPA vs. OPHCs.
