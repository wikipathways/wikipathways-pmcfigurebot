caption: Transcriptional changes associated with the protective effects of exercise
  against cocaine seeking. (A) Volcano plots depicting the differentially expressed
  transcripts in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of male rats in the early (n =
  4), throughout (n = 4), and late (n = 4) exercise groups, each relative to the saline
  group (n = 5), with statistically significant transcripts depicted in blue, purple,
  and pink for the early, throughout, and late comparisons, respectively (padj < .1,
  log2FC < 1.3). Grin1 is labeled in all 3 volcano plots. (B) Venn diagrams showing
  the overlap of the significantly up- and downregulated transcripts in the early,
  thru, and late groups, each compared with the saline group. The uniquely overlapping
  transcripts between early and throughout exercise are shown. (C) Bar plot depicting
  the enriched GO, WP, and CORUM terms using the significantly up- and downregulated
  transcripts in the early exercise vs. saline comparison. Bars with the same shade
  of blue represent terms gathered from the same database. (D) Bar plot depicting
  the enriched GO, TF, and CORUM terms using the significantly up- and downregulated
  transcripts in the throughout exercise vs. saline comparison. Bars with the same
  shade of purple represent terms gathered from the same database. (E) Bar plot depicting
  the enriched GO and CORUM terms using the significantly upregulated transcripts
  in the throughout exercise vs. saline comparison. Bars with the same shade of pink
  represent terms gathered from the same database. No terms were enriched using the
  significantly downregulated transcripts. (F) Saline-subtracted, normalized RNA sequencing
  paired-read density for Grin1 in the sedentary, early, throughout, and late exercise
  conditions were mapped to chromosome 3 of the rat rn6 genome using the Integrated
  Genome Viewer. Differential transcripts above saline (green) or below saline (red)
  are indicated relative to known RefSeq exon transcripts (blue). Adjusted p values
  were calculated with DESeq2 using the Wald test for significance after fitting to
  a negative binomial linear model and performing the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
  to limit false discoveries. GO, Gene Ontology; GOBP, GO biological process; GOCC,
  GO cellular component; GOMF, GO molecular function; log2FC, log2(fold change); padj,
  adjusted p; TF, transcription factor; thru, throughout; WP, WikiPathways.
