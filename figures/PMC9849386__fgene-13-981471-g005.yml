caption: The negative correlation between cellular senescence with pyruvate and lactate
  generation (A) The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly negatively correlated
  with Kegg Glycolysis Gluconeogenesis, among which Go Senescence pathway was the
  most relevant (r = −.874, p < .001). (B) The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly
  positively correlated with Kegg Glycolysis Gluconeogenesis, which were mainly concentrated
  in the saccharometabolism-related pathways. (C) ssGSEA score of Kegg Glycolysis
  Gluconeogenesis, Kegg Pyruvate Metabolis, Wp Glycolysis And Gluconeogenesis decreased
  in COVID-19.(D) The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly negatively correlated
  with Kegg Pyruvate Metabolis, among which Go Senescence pathway was the most relevant
  (r = −.93, p < .001).(E) The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly positively
  correlated with Kegg Pyruvate Metabolis. (F) These three glycolytic rate-limiting
  enzymes decreased in COVID-19 infection (HK, PFKL, PKLR and their isoenzymes). (G)
  The correlation of Kegg Glycolysis Gluconeogenesis, Kegg Pyruvate Metabolis with
  GO gene sets, KEGG pathways, and WIKIPATHWAYS pathways in COVID-19 group. (H) The
  correlation of Kegg Glycolysis Gluconeogenesis, Kegg Pyruvate Metabolis with GO
  gene sets, KEGG pathways, and WIKIPATHWAYS pathways in the Control group.(I) The
  top 20 genes strong negative correlation with HK1 (r < −.9, p < .05) by PPI and
  the top 20 genes strong positive correlation with HK1 (r > .9, p < .05) by PPI.
  (J) The top 20 genes strong negative correlation with PFKL (r < −.9, p < .05) by
  PPI and the top 20 genes strong positive correlation with PFKL (r > .9, p < .05)
  by PPI. (K) Several genes implicated in cell senescence are among the top 20 genes
  negatively correlated with HK1, PFKL or PFKM.
