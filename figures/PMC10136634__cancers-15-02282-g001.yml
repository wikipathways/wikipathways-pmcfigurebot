caption: Immune function genes from AA and EA breast cancer exosomes show a racial
  disparity. (A) Nanostring PanCancer Immune gene analysis, which includes 730 immune
  function genes, showed that, relative to EA breast cancer exosomes, AA breast cancer
  exosomes had lower expression of overall immune genes as well as innate immune response
  genes and adaptive immune response genes. (B) A volcano plot showed the differential
  expression of immune genes in AA and EA breast cancer exosomes, where a few genes
  such as CD47, CCL5, PPBP, and TGFB1 were increased in AA exosomes, whereas CD24,
  IL26, CTSL, and GAGE1 were increased in EA exosomes. (C) Cytoscape analysis showed
  that genes interacting through the chemokine signaling pathway, the cytokineâ€“cytokine
  receptor pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and the NF-kB signaling pathway were
  upregulated in AA exosomes as compared to EA exosomes (D) Differential expressions
  of chemokine, cytokine, and interleukin function genes in AA and EA breast cancer
  exosomes, notably PPBP, CXCL5, CCL5, and TGFB1 (involved in cancer progression)
  were increased in AA exosomes. (E) Hierarchical clustering showed that T-cell activation
  genes and CD8+ T cell genes were increased in EA exosomes, whereas macrophage marker
  genes, especially the expression CD47, were increased in AA exosomes.
