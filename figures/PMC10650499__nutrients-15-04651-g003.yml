caption: The results of pathway analysis (A) and the interaction of differential metabolites
  (B,C). (A) shows the top 20 smallest Q-value pathways (all Q value < 0.05), (B)
  shows the interaction of differential metabolites from the significant pathway of
  selenium micronutrient network (Wikipathways), and (C) shows the interaction of
  differential metabolites from significant pathways of metabolism of lipids (Reactome)
  and free fatty acid receptors (Reactome).
