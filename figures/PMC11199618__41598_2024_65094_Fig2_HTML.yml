caption: Protein–protein interaction network of HDAC6 identified in CNS. The interactions
  were derived from the literature using a semi-automated literature screen and were
  classified into five compartments based on the reported type and function of the
  interaction. The grey octagonal boxes represent protein complexes. The interactive
  pathway is available on Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.10082264) as well as WikiPathways
  under the accession number WP5426.
