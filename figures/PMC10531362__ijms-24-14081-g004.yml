caption: 'Enrichment analysis of the 89 upregulated genes associated with RHOJ in
  TCGA BLCA, GSE31684, and GSE32894 databases, performed using g:Profiler. g:Profiler
  was used to analyze the association and enrichment of the 89 upregulated genes in
  the TCGA BLCA, GSE31684, and GSE32894 databases. The results showed that the majority
  of these genes were significantly associated with Gene Ontology: molecular function
  (GO:MF), biological process (GO:BP), cellular component (GO:CC), Reactome pathways
  (REAC), WikiPathways (WP), transcriptional factor (TF), microRNA (MIRNA), and the
  link of the upregulated genes to certain disease phenotypes (Human Phenotype Ontology,
  HP). The x-axis shows the -log of the adjusted p-value for each category or pathwayâ€™s
  enrichment. This measure indicates the statistical significance of each enrichment,
  with higher values (toward the right) denoting higher significance after controlling
  for false discovery rate due to multiple testing. The size of each point (Rich Factor)
  represents the ratio of the number of enriched genes in each functional category
  or pathway to the total number of genes in that category or pathway. The color intensity
  of each point, depicted using a viridis color scale, represents the number of genes
  from the study associated with each category or pathway. Colors closer to yellow
  denote categories or pathways that encompass more genes from the study. Please refer
  to  for detailed information.'
