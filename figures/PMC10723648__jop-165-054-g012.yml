caption: 'Mithramycin (MTM) rescue of oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity reveals
  a unique cohort of DRG spliced genes. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) plot
  of splice events across 1533 OM and OV genes is shown. Red indicates MTM rescue
  group, and blue indicates OX treatment only. Differential alternative splicing analysis
  performed by RMAT. (B) Enrichment analysis identified differentially spliced genes
  dedicated to cytoskeleton intracellular transport and synaptic regulation as top
  pathways associated with MTM rescue in DRG. Databases (Metascape): GO Biological
  Processes, KEGG Pathway, Reactome Gene Sets, CORUM, PaGenBase, WikiPathways, and
  PANTHER Pathway. Log10(P) is the P-value in log base 10. DRG, dorsal root ganglion.'
