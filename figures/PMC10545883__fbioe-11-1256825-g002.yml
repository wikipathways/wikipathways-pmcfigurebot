caption: Workflows applied in this systematic review. (A) PRISMA2020 flow diagram
  for the whole process of study selection according to  and . (B) Over representation
  and network analysis of gene lists derived from the review process. Gene lists were
  compiled, listing examined genes, proteins or metabolites showing differential gene
  expression after FSS application in primary human or mouse cell lines (, ). From
  these, differential expressed gene (DEG) lists were generated according to the specified
  criteria. For both human and mouse DEG lists protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
  were constructed using STRING-DB () (). Pathway analysis was done using “GeneOntology/Biological
  Process” (), KEGG (), and WikiPathways () (). Subnetworks were identified in both
  PPI networks using the “GLay community detection algorithm” implemented in clusterMaker2
  () (, ). Essential nodes, so-called “hub genes”, were detected using cytoHubba ()
  (, ). Altogether 5 high-throughput gene expression studies applying microarray or
  RNA-seq methodology were identified studying the effect of FSS on either human MSCs
  or the mouse osteocyte cell line MLO-Y4. Raw data were downloaded from the respective
  repositories and individually processed using bioinformatics workflows. Pre-ranked
  gene lists were generated, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to
  each using easyGSEA (). Cell-type specific comparisons were done using easyVizR
  () (, ).
