caption: Gene importance from random forest breast cancer models built on pathway
  genes. Represented as circles, the gene content is sized and ordered by importance
  (large-to-small, bottom-to-top) for the top twenty-one pathways ordered by prediction
  accuracy (left-to-right). The “Top Gene” from Table  is represented by the largest,
  bottom-most circle and is labeled for each pathway. The vast majority of circles
  (gray) denote genes found only in PFOCR pathways among all significant pathways
  with “important” genes. The genes that are also present within Reactome and KEGG
  results are highlighted in red and blue, respectively. There were no significant
  pathways with gene importance scores above 0.1 from WikiPathways
