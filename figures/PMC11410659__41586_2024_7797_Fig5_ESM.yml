figure_title: Characterisation of dose-dependent response to RAS expression at single
  cell level in the liver model
caption: a,b, Projection of single cells coloured by pseudotime (a) or cluster as
  in Fig.  (b). c, Top 50 genes driving pseudotime ordering, arranged in order of
  similarity of expression pattern across pseudotime. d, Heatmap of average gene expression
  across single cells in each cluster for 899 secretome genes. The top 5 enriched
  KEGG pathways in each of the clusters are shown. Values, -log10(FDR), red dotted
  line indicates significance level of 0.05. e, Expression of all DNA damage-related
  gene sets from entire MsigDB across clusters. Terms were manually trimmed but the
  full descriptions are in Supplementary Table . GOBP = Gene Ontology Biological Process,
  REAC = Reactome, GOMF = Gene Ontology Molecular Function, WP = WikiPathways. f,
  Distribution of geneset scores for target genes of the indicated RAS downstream
  transcription factors across clusters.
