figure_title: GPR75 is highly expressed in the brain and directly binds to Gαq to
  regulate various downstream signaling pathways
caption: (A) Relative Gpr75 mRNA levels in different mouse tissues normalized by Polr2a
  (n = 3 mice). (B) Generation of 3xFlag-tagged Gpr75-knockin mice by CRISPR. Ex1,
  exon 1; Ex2, exon 2. (C) Immunoblot analysis of 3xFlag-Gpr75 protein expression
  in different mouse tissues (8-week-old males) by immunoprecipitation (IP). GAPDH
  was used as a loading control. IB, immunoblot. (D) Immunoblot analysis of 3xFlag-Gpr75
  protein expression in various brain regions (8-week-old males) by immunoprecipitation.
  GAPDH was used as a loading control. (E) Mass spectrometric identification of GPR75-interacting
  proteins from Flag immunoprecipitates of Gpr75-3xFlag–knockin brain lysates. (F)
  Immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitates (top and middle) and lysates (bottom)
  of 293T cells expressing HA-tagged Gnaq and 3xFlag-tagged Gpr75. (G) Summary of
  significantly changed genes (FDR <0.05) from RNA-Seq of hypothalamus from 8-week-old
  male WT and Gpr75–/– mice fed a chow diet or a HFD for 2 weeks (n = 3 mice for each
  group). (H and I) Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes in the hypothalamus
  of Gpr75–/– versus WT mice on a chow diet (H) or a 2-week HFD (I). Differentially
  expressed genes (FDR <0.05) are colored in red and blue indicating upregulation
  and downregulation, respectively. (J) Manhattan-like plot of pathways significantly
  associated (P < 0.05) with the loss of GPR75 on HFD feeding identified from a pathway
  overrepresentation analysis that mapped significant genes to the Reactome and WikiPathways
  databases. (K) Visualization of significantly associated pathways (P < 0.05) from
  J. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Data points represent individual mice in
  A, and data are representative of 3 independent experiments.
