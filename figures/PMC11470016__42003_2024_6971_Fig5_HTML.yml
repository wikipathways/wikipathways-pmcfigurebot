figure_title: RNA sequencing of molecular changes in Clec14a−/− lysates
caption: A–E Clustering and gene ontology analysis of Clec14a+/+ (WT) and Clec14a−/−
  pup calvaria lysates. A, B Unsupervised hierarchical clustering, (dendrogram – A;
  principal component analysis – B) of log2 normalised counting reads over exons (RPM-reads
  per million) for all detected genes, N = 4 for both groups. Clec14a−/− samples (blue),
  Clec14a+/+ samples (WT - orange). Each sample represents a different individual
  animal. C) Differentially expressed gene counts. Raw counts were analysed with DESeq2,
  significantly expressed genes were cut off at log2FC values > 0.5, adjusted p (padj)
  < 0.05, p value was corrected for multiple comparisons (Benjamini–Hochberg); Orange = genes
  upregulated in Clec14a−/− samples; Blue = genes downregulated in Clec14a−/− samples.
  D GSEA analysis enrichment score for pathways related to endochondral ossification.
  ES-enrichment score, FDR -false discovery rate. Gene expression is presented as
  a Z score (scale). E GSEA heatmap showing the list of leading-edge genes enriched
  at the top of the Wikipathways ‘Endochondral Ossification’ gene set. Heatmap presents
  upregulation of transcripts relevant to endochondral ossification in Clec14a−/−
  (blue) samples compared to WT control (orange). Gene expression is presented as
  a Z score. Transcripts presented were identified as statistically significant by
  GSEA analysis, FDR (q-value) < 0.05, nominal p < 0.01. F Analysis of expression
  of genes linked to osteoblast maturation and osteogenic activity. P4 pup calvarial
  lysates were subjected to RT qPCR analysis to dissect expression patterns of genes
  known to regulate commitment to osteoblast lineage and osteoblast maturation, gene
  expression was normalised to Gapdh, shown as arbitrary units (2^-ΔCT). Data is presented
  as median ± IQR, a Mann–Whitney test was used to analyse the results. Plots represent
  results from two independent experiments (n = 7 Clec14a+/+, n = 4–5 Clec14a−/−),
  data points in each graph are biological replicates.
