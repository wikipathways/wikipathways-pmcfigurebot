caption: The potential interactions of genes implicated in the EMT process with miR‐92a‐3p
  and miR‐1245b‐5p. (in databases including WikiPathways, MiRWalk, MirBase, Target
  scan, and MiRTarBase). The potential target genes of miR‐92a‐3p (green), miR‐1245b‐5p
  (purple), and common targets (pink) are shown in the picture.
