caption: 'Tenogenic mechano‐variant substrates abrogate TCP‐mediated inflammatory
  programs and favor tendon‐specific expression signature. A) Heatmap of gene‐level
  hierarchical clustering of the top 50 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in tendon
  stromal fibroblasts cultured on tenogenic substrates (E. ≈35 kPa) versus TCP control.
  Columns represent individual samples (N = 4 biological replicates from different
  donors). Blue denotes downregulated genes; red denotes upregulated genes. B) Functional
  annotation of S1 and S2 gene clusters in the heatmap (encompassing top 500 DEGs).
  Bar plots depict the fisher‐weighted, average correlations of the cluster with the
  annotation terms queried against MSigDB Hallmark database. C) RNA‐seq volcano plot
  of DEGs of 35kPa‐cultured human tenocytes relative to TCP controls. Colored dots
  show the 2787 significantly expressed genes, as determined by DESeq2 method, with
  the horizontal line corresponding to an FDR ≤0.01 and vertical lines are at a cutoff
  of log2[Fold change] ± 1. D) Enriched pathways analysis of a subset of DEGs using
  Enrichr queried against BioPlanet 2019 (BP), Reactome (R), WikiPathways 2019 (WP),
  and KEGG 2019 (K) Human databases. All hits had an adjusted p‐value < 0.05. E) Pre‐ranked
  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of positively and negatively enriched cellular
  components by Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) in 35 kPa cultured cells (Adjusted
  p‐value < 0.05). F,G) Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of Molecular Functions GO
  terms of F) upregulated and G) downregulated DEGs. Analysis was performed using
  a hypergeometric over‐representation test against the GO database, with significance
  achieved at q‐value < 0.05. H) Bar plot depicts the predicted top 10 most significantly
  enriched transcription factors upstream of the DEGs. Predicted TFs are sorted by
  significance level (adjusted p‐value < 0.05). I) Top 10 kinases upstream of predicted
  TFs in (F) were identified using the Kinase Enrichment Analysis module of the Expression2Kinase
  pipeline. J) GSEA enrichment plots of some of the top differentially expressed gene
  sets. The Plot''s black vertical lines represent the ranked gene hits in the gene
  set. The green line represents the normalized enrichment score (NES). The more the
  NES curve is skewed to the upper left of the plot, the more the gene set is enriched
  in the 35 kPa group. In contrast, when the curve shifts to the lower right, this
  reflects a more enrichment in the TCP control group. The red‐to‐blue colored scale
  at the bottom represents the degree of correlation of genes in the 35 kPa group
  with the phenotype in the gene set (Red: positive correlation; blue: negative correlation)
  or vice versa for the TCP control group. Note the significant negative regulation
  of gene set terms related to EMT, cellular proliferation, ECM assembly, and inflammation.
  K) GSEA enrichment plots of tendon‐specific (Top) and tendinopathy (bottom) signatures.'
