figure_title: Comparison of cell-type pathway enrichment in myenteric ganglia (MG)
  of porcine proximal and distal colon (p-pC, p-dC) with and without vagal nerve stimulation
  (VNS)
caption: The figures show the enrichment ratio of the same WikiPathway involving upregulated
  and downregulated genes in each list of differentially expressed genes and only
  show the enrichment ratio of the top five WikiPathways in cholinergic neurons a,
  glutamatergic neurons b, nitrergic neurons c, SLC41A1-glia d, and SPC24- glia e.
  The light blue color represents the cell-type enrichment ratio without VNS and the
  orange color represents the cell-type enrichment ratio with VNS.
