caption: 'Functional profiling of protein Network 2 and Network 3 identified among
  the set of dementia-associated proteinsProtein networks were assembled based on
  evidence of known gene/molecule interactions in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The
  g:Profiler toolkit was used to analyze the proteins in each dementia-associated
  protein network for functional enrichment. We defined the biological pathways/processes
  associated with each protein set using the Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and WikiPathways databases. Images were generated using
  the g:Profiler web tool: https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/.Abbreviations: GO:BP,
  gene ontology biological process; GO:MF, gene ontology molecular function'
