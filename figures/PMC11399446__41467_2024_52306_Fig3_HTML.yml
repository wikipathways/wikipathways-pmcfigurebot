figure_title: snRNA-seq analysis showing the clustering signature and composition
caption: a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plot shows the 78,979
  nuclei, mapping to 18 clusters. b Dot plot showing cluster identities aligned to
  canonical cell types in the adult mouse kidney based on a variety of cell type-specific
  marker genes. PT proximal tubules, LH(DL) Loop of Henle (Descending loop), LH(AL)
  Loop of Henle (Ascending loop), DCT distal convoluted tubule, CNT connecting tubule,
  CD-PC collecting duct principal cell, IC intercalated cell, Mø macrophage, PEC parietal
  epithelial cell, Prolif.PT Proliferating proximal tubules, Mes mesangial, Endo endothelial,
  Pod podocyte. Dot plot of all significantly (c) upregulated and (d) downregulated
  genes in the podocyte cluster between KLF6PODTA vs NPHS2-rtTA mice under diabetic
  conditions. Expression level of these genes is shown by the heat map and the percentage
  of cells expressing the gene in the cluster is shown by the size. The default statistical
  test (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, adjusted p-value based on Bonferroni correction) in
  Seurat package was used. Significantly expressed genes are determined by adjusted
  p < 0.05. Reactome, WikiPathways and KEGG enrichment analysis of these (e) upregulated
  and (f) downregulated genes in the podocyte cluster between KLF6PODTA vs NPHS2-rtTA
  mice under diabetic conditions. The default statistical test (fisher’s exact test)
  in Enrichr was used.
