caption: A The bar chart displays DGSS of gene sets, which indicates that the functions
  of ECM structure, basal lamina, collagen family, ECM receptor interaction, and negative
  regulation of angiogenesis were upregulated in the 1-cm margins compared with far-distance
  tissues. B Significant pathways, identified by WikiPathways, Bioplanet, and REACTOME
  databases with p-value < 0.05 were shown. The p-values of each pathway are illustrated
  in the dotted graphs. Among these pathways, ECM proteoglycan and synthesis of PG/TBX
  were still significant with p-Adj < 0.05, marked by the * sign
