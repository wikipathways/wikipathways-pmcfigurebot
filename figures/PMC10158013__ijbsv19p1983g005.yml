caption: Pathway analysis of the genes with a reduced AHR binding in the As3+-treated
  cells. (A) BioPlanet 2019 (top) and WikiPathways 2019 pathway analyses for 507 genes
  that showed significant reduction of AHR binding in cellular response to As3+. (B)
  ChIP-seq Enrichment Analysis (ChEA) showed coordinated regulation of the indicated
  transcription factors for those genes with reduced AHR binding. (C) Genome browser
  screenshots showing the pattern of AHR enrichment peaks on the gene loci of SLC7A5,
  SEMA3C and SUSD1 that exhibited reduced AHR binding induced by As3+.
