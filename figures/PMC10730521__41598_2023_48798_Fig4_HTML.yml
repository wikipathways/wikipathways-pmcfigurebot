caption: 'The DEGs and pathway enrichment analysis acquired unsupervised hierarchical
  clustering of LAMA3 stratified CCA sample of microarray dataset. (a) Heatmap image
  and (b) PCA plot indicating the separation low and high LAMA3 expression. (c) DEGs
  in high vs low LAMA3 expression group. Statistically significant DEGs cut-off are
  with the adjusted P < 0.05 and the Log2 FC of 3.32. (d) Pathway enrichment analysis
  of DEGs using EnrichR consolidated databases: BioPlanet, KEGG and Wikipathways.
  DEGs were considered at FC > 2 and P < 0.05. Enriched pathway were considered when combined
  score > 50.'
