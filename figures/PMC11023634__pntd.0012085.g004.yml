figure_title: Metascape meta-analysis results based on multiple genes dysregulated
  at 24 h post-infection
caption: The enrichment analysis was carried out with KEGG Pathway, Reactome Gene
  Sets, and WikiPathways as ontology sources. Heatmap showing the top 20 enrichment
  clusters for upregulated (A) and downregulated (B) set of genes found in L. infantum-,
  L. major- and L. tropica-infected cells. Significant functional enrichment terms
  were defined as those with p< 0.001. Gray color indicates a lack of significance.
