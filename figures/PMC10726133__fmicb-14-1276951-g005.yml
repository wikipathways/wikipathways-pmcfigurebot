caption: The host proteins identified from gallstone and polyp bile samples. (A) Gene
  ontology (GO) enrichment was performed on the upregulated human proteins in CHL
  compared to polyp using the g:Profiler tool (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost)
  (). (B) Differential expression of complement proteins between CHL and polyp samples.
  p values were calculated using unpaired Welchâ€™s t test. (C) Two mucin proteins were
  upregulated in CHL compared to polyp. (D) GO enrichment of the downregulated human
  proteins in CHL compared to polyp. GO_MF, Gene ontology of molecular function; GO_CC,
  cellular component; GO_BP biological process; REAC, Reactome; WP, WikiPathways.
  (E) Proteins associated with bile secretion were downregulated in CHL compared to
  polyp.
