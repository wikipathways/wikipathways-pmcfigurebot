caption: Pathway enrichment maps for proteome data sets. Pathway interaction plots
  for upregulated [(A); red] and downregulated [(C); blue] pathways in heart proteome
  data. Pathway interaction plots for upregulated [(B); red] and downregulated [(D);
  blue] pathways in plasma proteome data. Each rectangle represents a pathway. The
  size of the rectangle is proportional to the number of proteins annotated with the
  pathway. Two interacting pathways are connected by a line. The thickness of the
  line is proportional to the number of proteins shared between interacting pathways.
  Pathways are annotated with the source database as Biocarta (BIC), Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway
  Interaction Database (PID).
