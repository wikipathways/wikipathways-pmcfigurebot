caption: Effects of PERI administration on gene expression of the apoptosis signaling
  cascade. After 24 h of inhibitor incubation, gene expression was examined via targeted
  RNA sequencing. Subsequent data analysis was performed using TAC software. The WikiPathways
  plugin was used to integrate the FC expression values within the apoptosis signaling
  cascade. Green and red colors represent up- and downregulation, respectively. Genes
  with an average total read count < 50 were excluded to justify biological significance
  (labeled as filtered out).
