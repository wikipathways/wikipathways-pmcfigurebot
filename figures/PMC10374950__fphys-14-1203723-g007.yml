caption: Heatmap of autoantibody response pattern among different cohorts (A) and
  bar plots for pathway analysis. (A) Heatmap of relative estimates (case vs. control)
  of autoantibody responses to 56 proteins in the Discovery, Replication, and Combined
  cohorts. Only proteins with significantly altered autoantibody responses were selected.
  Red color indicates higher autoantibody responses, and blue color indicates lower
  autoantibody responses against the proteins. (B) KEGG and WIKIPathways analyses
  presented as bar-plot shows over-activated pathways in COVID-19 patients. Only pathways
  with t-test p-value â‰¤ 0.05 are presented in the bar plot.

  levels of autoantibodies related to the male reproductive system.
