caption: General characteristics of the immune signatures in HCC. (A). Volcano plot
  showed the different enrichment results of all immune signatures used in the study.
  (B). General view of the enrichment results in GO-BP, GO-CC, GO-MF, KEGG, Reactome
  and WikiPathways. (C). PPI showed the various clustered immune cells of myeloid
  cells and lymphocytes, and their potential connection with Ku70/Ku80. (D). GO enrichment
  showed the cell types of the immune signatures. (E). Dependency wheel showed the
  KEGG enrichment of the immune signatures. (F). Dependency wheel showed the GO-CC
  enrichment of the immune signatures.
