caption: Integrated multi-omics data analysis and functional enrichment analysis.
  (A) Heatmap of CR-cancer scores per multi-omics approach to prioritize the 31 essential
  CR-related proteins significantly involved in cancer (cutoff > 0.9). (B) The functional
  enrichment analysis displays the most significant annotations (Benjamini–Hochberg
  FDR < 0.01) related to the GO biological processes (http://geneontology.org/), the
  Reactome signaling pathways (https://reactome.org/), and the WikiPathways (https://www.wikipathways.org/)
  on cancer. The results of this enrichment were visualized using a Manhattan plot
  and were obtained through the g:Profiler software version e101_eg48_p14_baf17f0
  (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost). (C) Overall survival analysis comparing
  metastatic patients with genomic alterations in 10 essential CR-related genes (n = 15,194)
  versus unaltered patients (n = 10,465). Unaltered patients had a median month average
  (55.72) significantly higher than altered patients (31.64) showing a log rank test
  P < 0.001. CR circadian rhythm, GO gene ontology, WP WikiPathways, BP biological
  processes, FDR false discovery rate, MSK-MET Memorial Sloan Kettering–Metastatic
  Events and Tropism, CI confidence intervals.
