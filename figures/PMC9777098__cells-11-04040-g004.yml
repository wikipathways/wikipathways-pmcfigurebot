caption: 'Network representation of enriched GO terms/pathways obtained from the differentially
  expressed genes in hEDS/HSD. Functionally grouped clusters based on “Biological
  Process” and “Molecular Function” GO categories and WikiPathways, KEGG and Reactome
  pathways with terms as nodes linked based on their κ score level = 0.7 through Cytoscape.
  The GO terms “fusion” and “all experimental evidence” were selected to create the
  network. Two-sided hypergeometric test and Benjamini–Hochberg statistical correction
  were applied and only enriched pathways with a p-value ≤ 0.01 were selected. Other
  considered parameters were minimum and maximum tree GO interval values of 3–8, with
  a minimum number of three genes and 7% of genes selected for GO terms. Different
  node colors represent different GO categories/enriched pathways: green identify
  downregulated clusters, red upregulated ones. The increase in green and red color
  gradient represents higher amounts of the contribution of up- and downregulated
  genes, respectively. The size of the nodes is indicative of their statistical significance
  of the terms.'
