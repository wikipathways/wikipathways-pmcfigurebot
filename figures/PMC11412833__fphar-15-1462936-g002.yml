caption: High dose EC treatment alters the expression of complement regulators, favoring
  a hyperactive alternative complement pathway. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG), (B) WikiPathways, and (C) Rat Genome Database (RGD) pathway enrichment
  analyses of differentially expressed genes in renal transcriptome derived from high
  dose ethyl carbamate (EC)-treated rats versus normal control rats highlights the
  most affected pathways with significant statistical difference and high enrichment
  score. (D) The KEGG pathway map hsa04610 is involved in EC-induced kidney injury.
  The rectangle in red color indicates the EC-perturbed genes. (E) Heatmap representation
  and hierarchical cluster analysis of the differentially expressed genes enriched
  in complement pathway in kidneys from high dose EC-injured rats. Color scale represents
  the relative gene expression value for each gene using log2 median-centered intensity
  values. (F) Renal expression of mRNA levels of indicated genes in EC-treated rats
  and control rats (n = 2). (G) DEGs with statistical significance were subjected
  to enrichment analysis based on disease ontology (DO).
