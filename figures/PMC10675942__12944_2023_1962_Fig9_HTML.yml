caption: Biological characteristics of different IVDD subtypes. A A representative
  heatmap depicting the differences in the immune landscape in IVDD between Subtype
  A and Subtype B, as determined using CIBERSORT, TIMER, QUANTISEQ, CIBERSORT-ABS,
  EPIC, and XCELL algorithms. The bar chart on the right elucidates the correlation
  between immune cells or stromal cells and their respective subtypes. B A heatmap
  illustrating differential pathway activity between the two subtypes, based on GSVA
  using the KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways databases
