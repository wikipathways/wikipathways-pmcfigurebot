caption: 'Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the differential genes between
  the COVID-19 group and the control group (including the increased gene set and the
  decreased gene set). (A,C,E) gene sets were enriched in GO, KEGG, WIKIPATHWAYS,
  respectively, and the top 30 enrichment pathways were selected according to Adj-p-Value
  from small to large. (B,D,F) decreased gene sets were enriched in GO, KEGG, WIKIPATHWAYS,
  respectively, and the top 30 enrichment pathways were selected according to Adj-p-Value
  from small to large. (G) The expression of several typical sperm Markers: TNP1,
  PRM1 and PRM2 decreased significantly in COVID-19 group (p <.001). (H) The expression
  of classical Marker: CA2 decreased after COVID-19 infection (p < .001). (I) The
  ssGSEA score of Germ Cell Development pathway decreased in COVID-19 group (p < .001).'
