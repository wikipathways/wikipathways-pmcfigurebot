caption: Overlap in content among source databases. Only analytes mapping to pathways
  are considered, as HMDB contains a large number of metabolites associated only with
  ontologies, which are not relevant to Reactome and Wikipathways as pathway-centric
  databases. (A) Overlap in metabolites associated with at least one pathway between
  source databases in RaMP. (B) Overlap of genes associated with at least one pathway.
  The filled circle(s) underneath each bar in the plots demonstrate the source databases
  that the analyte counts are drawn from
