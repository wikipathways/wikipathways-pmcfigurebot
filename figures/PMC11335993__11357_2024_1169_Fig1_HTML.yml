caption: 'Aβ drives proteome-wide protein insolubility that resembles normal aging.
  A Schematic of experimental procedure, created with Biorender.com. B Schematic overview
  of proteostasis machineries and mitochondrial proteins enriched in the Aβ-driven
  insoluble proteome. C Total insoluble protein Intensity in worms expressing Aβ vs
  genotype control strain CL2122, all values normalized to the average of the control
  in each experiment n = 4, error bars = SEM, Mann-Whitney Test, created with Biorender.com.
  D Barplot of selected enriched GO terms, KEGG pathways and Wikipathways in the Aβ
  insoluble proteome, Benjamini Hochberg FDR <5% (see supplementary tables for complete
  list). E Left: Overlap of proteins enriched in the insoluble proteome of old C.

  Right: Overlap of aging insoluble proteome with Aβ-driven insoluble proteome, p < 0.0001
  Fischer’s exact test. F KEGG disease pathways enrichment of human orthologues of
  core insoluble proteome, Benjamini Hochberg FDR < 5%'
