caption: 'RNA-sequencing reveals potential pathways for defibrotide regulation of
  COVID-19-associated pulmonary injury and COVID-19 plasma-induced MVEC activation
  and injuryA. A spatial tissue atlas providing single cell RNAseq data of MVEC (capillary)
  genes from autopsy lung tissue of acute COVID-19 patients was used to generate a
  gene enrichment set for transcripts differentially upregulated or downregulated
  in pulmonary capillary EC vs. control tissue.B. Three distinct pathway analyses
  using KEGG, Gene Ontology (GO), and WikiPathways databases were used to generate
  heatmaps of transcripts prominently involved in defibrotide modulation of COVID-19
  plasma-induced changes in MVEC in vitro.C. Heatmaps of the six cellular mechanisms
  most prominently altered by defibrotide in our COVID-19 plasma-exposed MVEC cultures:
  TNF-Î± signaling; IL-17 signaling; ECM-EC and platelet receptor interactions; ECM
  formation; endothelin synthesis and activity; and fibrosis. Up-regulated transcripts
  are shown in red and down-regulated transcripts are shown in blue. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of this article.)'
