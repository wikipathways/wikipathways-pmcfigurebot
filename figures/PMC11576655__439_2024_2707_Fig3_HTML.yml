caption: 'Significantly over-represented pathways for candidate genes derived from
  duplication-only (DUP) and loss of function (LOF) CNV_GWAS. Significantly enriched
  pathways are ordered by adjusted p-value (most-to-least significant) of 58 and 116
  candidate genes derived from duplication-only and loss of function GWAS. Reactome
  (REAC) (Fabregat et al., 2018), KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2019), WikiPathways (WP)
  (Slenter et al., 2018), Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2011), Human Phenotype
  Ontology (HP) (Köhler et al., 2019) were selected as annotation databases. Heatmap
  on left depicts which CNV-GWAS candidate genes were overrepresented. Gene sets on
  right side of figure encompass multiple genes: 16p11.2A = SPN, QRPT, C16orf54, ZG16,
  MAZ, MVP, CDIPT, SEZ6L2, ASPHD1, KCTD13, TMEM219, HIRIP3, DOC2A, C16orf92, ALDOA,
  TBX6, GDPD. Stress = CYP1B1, FGF12, PPARA, BCLAF1, POLQ, FANCM, ERCC2, GML. Membrane = SLC6A3,
  SLCO1B3, DLG2, TMEM231, SLC19A1, SLC4A7. Genes denoted with * denote additional
  gene loci identified via recurrent 16p deletion identified in LOF CNV-GWAS but were
  also represented in other enriched pathways'
