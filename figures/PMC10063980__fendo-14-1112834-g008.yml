caption: Characterization of in vitro D30 vs. in vivo 36.5 dpp gene lists. (A) Manhattan
  plot illustrating the functional enrichment analysis on in vitro D30 (n=4) vs. in
  vivo 36.5 dpp (n=3) input gene list. The x-axis represents functional terms that
  are grouped and colour-coded by data sources. The circle sizes are in accordance
  with the corresponding term size (i.e., larger terms have larger circles). The GO
  Terms locations on the x-axis is fixed and GO Terms from the same GO subtree are
  located closer to each other. The GO Terms lists were presented as -log10(padj)
  enrichment score calculated using the formula log10 (FDR). (B) Pie chart representation
  of D30 vs. 36.5 dpp GO Terms (B1, molecular function; B2, biological process; B3,
  cellular component), reactome (B4), and WikiPathways (B5) data sources. GO Terms
  with the highest padj are located at noon. The surface taken by GO Terms is relative
  to the proportion of the number of times they were related within DEGs studied.
  The data can be consulted at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gplink/l/humNT-dmTT. dpp, days
  postpartum; FDR, false discovery rate; GO, gene onthology.
