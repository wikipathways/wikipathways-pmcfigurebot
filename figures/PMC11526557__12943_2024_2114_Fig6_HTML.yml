caption: 'IL6ST signaling in PCa patients actives STAT3 signaling and upregulates
  senescence, immune score and cytotoxicity. a Fast pre-ranked gene set enrichment
  analysis (fGSEA) of significantly enriched HALLMARK gene sets with genes regulated
  in IL6SThigh compared to IL6STlow expressing patients from the TCGA-PRAD data set.
  Dotted line: adj. p-value (-log10(0.05)), blue: downregulated, red: upregulated;
  b fGSEA of the previously described core SASP gene signature upon PICS “Core SASP
  of PICS (Guccini)” (upper panel) and the curated gene set, class chemical and genetic
  perturbations (CGP) “CGP: Fridman senescence up” (lower panel) with genes regulated
  in IL6SThigh compared to IL6STlow expressing patients from the TCGA-PRAD data set.
  Genes sorted based on their Wald statistics are represented as vertical lines on
  the x-axis. NES: normalized enrichment score. c fGSEA of WikiPathways (WP) gene
  sets “REACTOME: Cell cycle”, “REACTOME: G1/S transition” and “WP: p53 transcriptional
  gene network” with genes regulated in IL6SThigh compared to IL6STlow expressing
  patients from the TCGA-PRAD data set. Genes sorted based on their Wald statistics
  are represented as vertical lines on the x-axis. NES: normalized enrichment score.
  d Immune score from the ESTIMATE method for IL6STlow (red, n = 208) and IL6SThigh
  (blue, n = 283) patients from the TCGA-PRAD data set, compared with Mann–Whitney
  test. e fGSEA of the top 20 T-cell-, neutrophil-, and macrophage-associated Biological
  Processes from Gene Ontology pathways (GO-BP) gene sets with genes significantly
  regulated in IL6SThigh compared to IL6STlow expressing patients from the TCGA-PRAD
  data set. Dotted line: adj. p-value (-log10(0.05)), red: upregulated;'
