caption: Representative results of functional enrichment analysis enriched by 52 DE-FRGs.
  (A) GO enrichment analysis. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (C) Cellular processes
  in KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (D) Reactome pathway enrichment analysis. (E)
  WikiPathways enrichment analysis. A In GO term, bubbles with square, round, and
  triangle shapes stand for cellular component, biological process, and molecular
  function, respectively. (Aâ€“E) The size of the bubble shows the number of enriched
  genes. Red indicates smaller p-values and blue indicates larger p-values. All results
  satisfy p < 0.05.
