figure_title: Neural injury and non-myelinating Schwann cell signatures identified
  in murine transcriptomic analysis are expressed in human PDAC and gastrointestinal
  tumors
caption: (A) Gene expression analysis of undefined Schwann cell markers, non-myelinating
  Schwann cells, and acinar genes from TH+ regions in tumor fibers, bundles and acinar
  regions. (B) Gene ontology analysis using WikiPathways of the most upregulated pathways
  based on differential gene expression analysis of TH+ fibers in tumor tissues and
  TH+ fibers in acinar tissue (C-D) Graphical analysis of tumor injury model and non-myelinating
  Schwann cell transcriptional activation during neural injury. (E-L) Histological
  analysis of images containing JUND protein signatures from the Human Protein Atlas
  (HPA) for multiple tumor types and their corresponding healthy organ. (E) normal
  pancreas (F) PDAC low magnification (G) PDAC high magnification (H) liver (I-J)
  liver cancer (K) stomach (L-M) stomach cancer (Dotted box denotes low magnification
  while dotted line denotes nerve contour. Scale bar (200 um) in figure E applies
  to F, H, I, L, Scale bar in figure G applies to J, M.
