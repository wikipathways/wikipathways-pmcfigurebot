caption: Integrate network pharmacology and pharmacological analysis identifying the
  active ingredient of Jisuikang (JSK). (A) The chemical compounds of 6 herbs in JSK
  were retrieved from Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database (TCMSP,
  http://lsp.nwu.edu.cn/tcmsp.php). Differentially expressed genes between spinal
  cord injury samples and normal control samples were obtained based on GSE42828 and
  GSE5296. The intersection of these sets highlights 239 overlapping genes. Among
  them, 231 genes were consistently differentially expressed in the two GSE sets.
  (B) Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of the 231 DEGs shows significant
  interactions between the target genes identified using the STRING database with
  a confidence score > 0.7. The nodes represent target genes, and the edges represent
  the interactions between them. (C) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the
  231 DEGs, indicating processes such as inflammatory response, DNA biosynthetic process
  regulation, and chemokine responses. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis shows
  significant pathways like NF‐kappa B signalling, TNF signalling, and apoptosis.
  (E) WikiPathways enrichment analysis displaying key pathways involved in spinal
  cord injury and apoptosis.
