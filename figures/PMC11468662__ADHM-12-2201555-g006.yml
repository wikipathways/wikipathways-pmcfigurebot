caption: Transcriptional changes in the thyroid OoC model following benzo(k)fluoranthene
  (BKF) exposure. A) Brightfield images of thyroid follicles after BKF exposure in
  static versus flow conditions. Images were overlapped with the fluorescence signal
  of the GFP flag. Scale bar, 100 µm. B) Venn diagram showing the overlap in sets
  of differentially expressed genes upon BKF exposure in static and flow conditions
  (n = 3). C,D) Top 15 significantly enriched (adjusted p < 0.05) gene ontology biological
  processes C) and pathways D) in response to BKF treatment. The top 15 enriched terms
  in flow and static condition are presented with respective adjusted P values (dotted
  line, adjusted p value < 0.05). Enrichment analysis for gene ontology (GO) biological
  processes and Wikipathways was performed using Enrichr. The complete list of significantly
  enriched GO biological processes and pathways can be found in Figures  and  (Supporting
  Information), respectively. E,F) Fold changes of differentially expressed (DE) genes
  of the AhR pathway E) and the TH generation F) in response to BKF exposure as compared
  to control samples (n = 3). Y‐axis shown in log scale. Differential expression analysis
  was performed with R using the DESeq2[] and edgeR[] packages. **p < 0.01, ****p
  < 0.0001. Cyp1a1, cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1; Cyp1b1, cytochrome
  P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1; Ahrr, aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor; Tiparp,
  TCDD inducible poly(ADP‐Ribose) polymerase. Nis, sodium iodide symporter; Tpo, thyroperoxidase;
  Duoxa2, dual oxidase maturation factor 2.
