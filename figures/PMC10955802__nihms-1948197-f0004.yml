figure_title: COL6A3 is a predicted key driver gene of 28.CT_LIV SAM and a senescence-associated
  gene
caption: (A) Pathway enrichment analysis by ClueGO of 28.CT_LIV module genes and genes
  from three liver COL6A3 target modules 37.TS_SF, 219.TS_BLOOD, and 61.TS_Blood.
  Nodes (pathways) are colored according to functional groups revealed by the network
  edges connecting terms with shared genes between the terms (default setting, Kappa
  score Cytoscape, Bonferroni adj p < 0.01, KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways, , tab S14.2).
  Node size reflects pathway term adj p value (largest p < 0.0005, middle p = 0.0005–.005,
  smallest p = 0.005–.05).(B) Expression by qRT-PCR of COL6A3 expression as normalized
  to RPLP0 showing ~5-fold reduction in COL6A3 expression following short hairpin
  RNA (shRNA)-targeted COL6A3 knockdown in IMR90 cells. Experimental protocol is shown
  as inset.(C and D) Heatmaps summarizing the significance of enrichment (–log adj
  p value) of DEGs after COL6A3 knockdown in IMR90 cells with respect to (C) senescence
  DEGs or (D) select SAMs from (A). Genes either up-, down-, or up- + downregulated
  were tested. A curated signature from Williams et al. included COL6A3 knockdown
  in myofibroblasts following either 4 or 6 days of perturbation was also tested in
  (D). Text in the heatmap in (C) are the fold enrichment values.
