caption: Transcriptomic comparison of stiffness‐sensing in human tendon stromal cells.
  A) Schematic overview of the range of substrate stiffnesses that were used to interrogate
  stiffness‐sensing in this study. Healthy human tendon‐derived cells were isolated
  from patients who underwent autograft tendon transfer for the repair of knee anterior
  cruciate ligament (ACL). Freshly dissociated cells were directly seeded on PDMS
  substrates without the standard expansion on tissue culture plastics. B) RNA‐seq
  volcano plots of DEGs across different stiffness comparisons. Differential expression
  was determined by DESeq2 method. Colored values represent significant DEGs, which
  are defined with cut‐off values of |fold change| ± 1 and p‐value < 0.01. C) Venn
  diagram depicting the overlapped significantly expressed genes (DEGs) between the
  different stiffness comparisons. D,E) Top 10 enriched pathways for each stiffness
  comparison; D) 35 kPa versus 180 kPa, E) 2 kPa versus 180 kPa. Enrichment analysis
  was performed in Enrichr using both up‐regulated and down‐regulated genes. DEGs
  were interrogated against BioPlanet 2019 (BP), Reactome (R), WikiPathways 2019 (WP),
  KEGG 2019 (K) databases. The list of significantly enriched pathways was manually
  curated, and it is listed according to the smallest p‐values obtained across all
  the databases. F) Shared enriched biological processes (BP) GO terms between the
  indicated stiffness comparisons using gProfiler over‐representation analysis of
  both upregulated and downregulated DEGs. G,H) Top enriched biological processes
  (BP) GO terms in each stiffness comparison; G) 35 kPa versus 180 kPa, H) 2 kPa versus
  180 kPa. Overrepresentation analysis was performed using hypergeometric overrepresentation
  test against the GO database with both upregulated and downregulated DEGs. Significance
  achieved at q‐value < 0.05. I–K) Bar plots show the predicted top 10 most significantly
  enriched transcription factors upstream of the DEGs. Predicted TFs are sorted by
  significance level (adjusted p‐value < 0.05), and were inferred using the TF Enrichment
  Analysis modules of the Expression2Kinase tool. L) ISMARA inferred regulatory motif
  analysis of predicted TFs activity at proximal promoter regions, as a function of
  the substrate stiffness. Dot plots depict ISMARA‐predicted activity of SMAD3, ZNF148,
  AND TEAD3‐TEAD1 motifs. M–O) Bar plots indicate the predicted top 10 most significantly
  enriched kinases upstream of the DEGs. Predicted kinases are ranked by significance
  level (adjusted p‐value < 0.05). Kinases were predicted using the Kinase Enrichment
  Analysis modules of the Expression2Kinase tool. P) Representative immunoblot and
  quantification of Phospho‐Akt(Ser473) kinase. Data are from two independent biological
  donors. All data is shown as fold change to TCP.
