caption: 'Distinct proteomic profiles of SF EVs compared with plasma EVs of knee OA
  participants. EVs from the matched SF and plasma of the knee OA ‘proteomics cohort’
  (n = 16) were processed for proteomics. (A) Sample analysis plan and list of peptides
  and their corresponding proteins enriched in SF compared with plasma (termed peptidesSF>PL,
  proteinsSF>PL) based on differential missingness (none, some, or compete exclusivity
  in one group). Comparisons of relative quantitative values were performed using
  a paired t-test with FDR adjustment with the BH procedure; statistical significance
  was defined as p < 0.05. For peptides with some or all values missing in a group,
  comparisons of missing rates were performed using McNemar’s test with FDR adjustment
  with BH procedure; statistical significance was defined as adjusted p < 0.05. Peptide
  information is presented in –. (B-D) STRING network analysis of the identified proteinsSF>PL:
  the bar graphs display the top 10 enriched cellular components based on the observed
  gene counts (B), and the top 10 enriched Wikipathways, reactome pathways, biological
  process and disease associations based on FDR (C); the graph displays the full STRING
  network (D); the 469 edges indicate the functional and physical protein associations;
  processes indicated by each node colors of the network are provided in the legend
  (D).'
