figure_title: Functional enrichment analysis of APOE-ε4-dependent protein-protein
  interaction partners
caption: a) A scheme of the PPI partners selection, where first degree partners of
  the APOE-ε4-dependent proteins were extracted from the InWeb database. b-c) Enrichment
  of selected GO terms for the PPI partner proteins shown as b) dotplot and c) gene-concept
  network. d-e) Enrichment of top seven unique Wikipathways shown as d) dotplot and
  e) gene-concept network. BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular
  function.
