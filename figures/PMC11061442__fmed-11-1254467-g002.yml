caption: Differential pTSS coverages between early- or late-onset PE and controls.
  Volcano plots showed promoters with differential cfDNA coverages between early-onset
  PE and healthy samples (A) or between late-onset PE and healthy samples (B). The
  red, blue, and grey dots indicated pTSS coverages were significantly higher, lower,
  and non-significant in early- or late-onset PE compared to control samples, respectively.
  Barplots showed the results of pathway enrichment analysis based on genes with differential
  pTSS coverages between early-onset PE and healthy samples (C) or between late-onset
  PE and healthy samples (D). KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; WP, WikiPathways.
