caption: Transcriptome analysis of DEGs on day 13 compared to day 0. (A) Global mRNA
  expression patterns between day 13 and day 0. The MA plot shows upregulated (red
  color) and downregulated (green color) DEGs on day 13. (B) Bar graph representations
  of the top three enriched GO_BP terms (grey bars), KEGG pathways (orange bars),
  Reactome pathways (green bars), and Wikipathways (blue bars) for the upregulated
  DEGs according to adjusted p-values. (C) Bar graph representations of the top three
  enriched GO_BP terms (grey bars), KEGG pathways (orange bars), Reactome pathways
  (green bars), and Wikipathways (blue bars) for the downregulated DEGs according
  to adjusted p-values. (D) GSEA demonstrates significant enrichment for autonomic
  development-associated genes on day 13. The heatmap displays the expression changes
  of genes in the enrichment plot.
