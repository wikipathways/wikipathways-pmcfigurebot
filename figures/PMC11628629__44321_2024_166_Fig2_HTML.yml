figure_title: RNA profiling of EGFR-deficient hair follicle stem cells identifies
  hallmarks of scarring hair follicle destruction
caption: (A) Representative FACS plot of sorting strategy for CD34+ScaI- HFSCs (red
  box) of WT and EGFRΔEgr2 mice at 1 M of age. (B) DoRothEA transcription factor analysis
  of the HFSC RNAseq dataset. (C) Heatmap with z-scores of selected differentially
  expressed genes of the HFSC RNAseq dataset from WT and EGFRΔEgr2 mice. (D) IF analysis
  and quantification of proliferation (Ki67, red) in HFSCs (CD34, green) from skin
  sections of WT and EGFRΔEgr2 mice at 1 M and 2 M of age (n = 13, 5 hair follicles
  per n). The white arrowheads mark examples for double-positive Ki67- and CD4-positive
  cells. Asterisk (*) highlights the additional proliferative bulb. WT vs EGFRΔEgr2
  2 M p = 0.0397. (E) Top 20 gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) WikiPathways from
  the HFSC RNAseq dataset. (F) Skin section IF staining of apoptosis (Caspase 8, red;
  n = 16, 3 hair follicles per n) and intermediate filament (Vimentin, red, E-Cadherin,
  green) expression in the hair follicle of WT and EGFRΔEgr2 mice at 3 M of age (n = 8,
  5 hair follicles per n). The white arrowheads mark double-positive Casp8- and CD34-positive
  or Vimentin- and E-Cadherin-positive cells. Asterisk (*) highlights Vimentin+ dermal
  cells associated around the hair follicle. Casp8+ WT vs EGFRΔEgr2p < 0.0001. Vim+
  WT vs EGFRΔEgr2p = 0.018. (G) H&E histochemistry of WT and EGFRΔEgr2 at 5 M, red
  arrows indicate follicular plugging and a fibrotic hair follicle (indicated with
  a dotted line). WT vs EGFRΔEgr2p = 0.0179. (H) Number of hair follicle units per
  1500 μm of H&E stained sections of WT and EGFRΔEgr2 skin at 10 M of age. Data is
  presented in ±SEM, *p < 0.05, ****p < 0.0001 by unpaired t-test, n ≥ 3. .
