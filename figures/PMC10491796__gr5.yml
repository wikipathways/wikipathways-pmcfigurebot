caption: Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins in ELT-3Â cells
  treated with Manz A. (A) Functional enrichment analysis of up-regulated proteins
  by using Enricher. Bar graphs represent fold enrichment of pathways annotated in
  gene ontology biological processes (GOBP) and WikiPathways. (B) Functional enrichment
  analysis of down-regulated proteins by using Enricher. Bar graphs represent fold
  enrichment of pathways annotated in gene ontology biological processes (GOBP) and
  WikiPathways. Values represent -log10 (Adjusted P-value).
