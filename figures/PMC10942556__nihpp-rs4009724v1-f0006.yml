caption: PPARγ as a key regulating factor of cellular senescence in alveolar macrophages.
  A, Six gene modules identified by the hdWGCNA analysis focused on Leiden cluster
  1. B, Brown module was positively correlated with the difference in cellular senescence
  between ACO and control groups. C, Top 30 hub genes withhigh correlations in the
  brown module. D-F, Different pathways in the brown module were identified by WikiPathways
  (D), Reactome (E)and KCGG (F). G, Top 10 specific regulons for Leiden cluster 1
  ranked by score value generated from PySCENIC. H, Transcription factor enrichment
  analysis within the brown module against the TRRUST database.
