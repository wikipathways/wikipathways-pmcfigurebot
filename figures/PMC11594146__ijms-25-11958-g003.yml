caption: Bioinformatics analysis of key genes and corresponding transcription factors
  involved in the development of influenza virus infection. (A,B) Graphs showing the
  dynamics of DEG expression levels during the course of influenza infection in the
  most representative GSE dataset, obtained through the STEM clusterization analysis.
  Only DEGs in the same profile as indicated by STEM are shown on the graphs. Different
  graph colors indicate different genes. (C,D) Functional analysis of the DEGs in
  the STEM clusterization profiles. Enrichment for Gene Ontology (biological processes),
  KEGG, REACTOME, and WikiPathways terms were performed using ClueGO plugin in Cytoscape.
  Only pathways with p < 0.05 after Bonferroni step-down correction for multiple testing
  were included. (E) Venn diagram demonstrating common genes between DEGs identified
  at 10–12 d.p.i. (upper Venn diagram) and 7 d.p.i. (lower Venn diagram), and heatmap
  showing expression levels of identified DEGs in all analyzed datasets. (F) Identification
  of transcription factors regulating the expression of identified DEGs through iRegulon
  plugin in Cytoscape software. Only transcription factors and DEGs present in motifs
  with NES higher than 10 are shown. Green nodes—transcription factors, blue nodes—DEGs
  identified in (E), pink—DEGs absent in performed Venn diagram analysis. Numbers
  under lines near transcription factors indicate NES scores.
