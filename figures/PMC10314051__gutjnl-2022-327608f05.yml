caption: Immune-related alterations in relation to CRC histology. (A) Boxplots of
  deconvoluted abundancies of distinct immune cell populations across histologies
  in the Vimentin segment. (B) Forest plot of Spearmanâ€™s Rho and corresponding 95%
  CI for the correlation between enrichment score of immune-related pathways from
  WikiPathways and histology as ordinal variable. Correlation was assessed in PanCK
  and Vimentin segments separately. (C) Expression of immunomodulators across distinct
  regions in the Vimentin segment. AOIs (columns) are ordered by histology and subsequently
  by sample ID. Expression z-score was calculated in epithelial and stromal segments
  separately. Type of immunomodulator, either inhibitory or stimulatory, is indicated.
  An unsupervised version of the heatmap with PanCK and Vimentin regions combined,
  using unsupervised clustering for both rows and columns, is included as . (D) Line
  graphs of expression of CD47 and SIRPA during tumourigenesis. Mean enrichment score
  and corresponding 95% CI are indicated. CRC, colorectal cancer; log2FC, log2 fold
  change; PanCK, pan-cytokeratin; ROI, region of interest.
