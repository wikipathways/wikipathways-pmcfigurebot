caption: Illustration of sex-specific differential gene expression in the ‘Neural
  Crest Differentiation’ pathway from the WikiPathways database in Alzheimer’s disease
  prefrontal cortex RNA-seq data (shown is a segment of the adapted pathway diagram
  enriched in male-specific changes). Each box represents a gene, and the colors reflect
  the estimated log fold change in patients versus controls for females (left side)
  and males (right side). Over- and under-expression is indicated by a blue to red
  color gradient (see legend on the right), lack of significant expression changes
  is indicated by a white color. The diagram shows a male-specific overrepresentation
  of underexpressed genes in patients (in female patients either no significant change
  in expression is observed or an increased expression, as for the gene ASCL1).
