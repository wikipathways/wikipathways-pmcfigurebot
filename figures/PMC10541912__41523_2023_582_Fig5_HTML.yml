figure_title: The Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathway is strongly associated with invasiveness of
  cells expressing different p53 mutants
caption: a Biplots for a PLSR model trained on ssGSEA scores of the entire pathway
  terms in WikiPathways database and the vector of invasiveness is shown. The model
  was based on top 5 pathway terms that were identified by cross-validated forward
  feature selection. Cell lines (colored by invasiveness) were transformed and projected
  on a 2-component space, and the explained variance of invasiveness by each component
  is shown in the axis labels. The loadings of pathway terms were scaled to fit the
  data range and displayed as green lines. b Biplot for a PLSR model trained on expression
  values of genes in the Hippo-YAP Signaling Pathway (WikiPathways) and the vector
  of invasiveness is shown. Analysis performed as described for Fig. 5a. c In the
  WikiPathways diagrams for the Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathways, individual genes were color-coded
  by the Pearson correlations between gene expression levels and invasiveness across
  the 13 cell lines. d Transcriptional activity of TEAD proteins was measured in the
  13-cell line panel in triplicates by a cell-based luciferase reporter assay. The
  luminescence values were normalized to the log2 fold changes over the WTOE values.
  The difference between a group of two more invasive cells (R273C and Y220C) and
  four less invasive cells (Y234C, WT, H179R, and G245S) was tested by the two-sided
  Student’s t-test. Pearson’s correlation between the normalized TEAD activities and
  the invasiveness across the cell lines was also calculated (bottom box).
