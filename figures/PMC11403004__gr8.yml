caption: Identification of core immune genes of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
  (A, B) The optimal soft threshold was determined by WGCNA. (C) Dendrogram of all
  differentially expressed genes based on dissimilarity measure (1-TOM) clustering.
  (D) The four modules obtained by WGCNA. (E) Comparison of immune subtype scores
  in different modules. (F) Multifactor Cox analysis of different module scores. (G)
  Prognostic curves of MEblue. (H) The network diagram showing the relationship between
  the enrichment pathways. (I) The bar chart showing the top 20 enriched functions
  and pathways of genes, including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology,
  WikiPathways, and Reactome database enrichment analysis results.
