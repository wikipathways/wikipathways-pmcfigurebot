caption: Description of work flow for analysis of blood RNA transcriptional profiles
  in COVID-19 cases. Samples were categorized based on COVID-19 cases with Symptomatic
  or Asymptomatic infections. They were identified by their infecting SARS-CoV-2 variant
  as wildtype, or Variants of Concern (VOC). Whole blood was processed for RNA microarray
  analysis using the Affymetrix system and differentially regulated genes identified
  (DEGs) identified. These were analysed by bioinformatics analysis using KEGG GO,
  Reactome and WikiPathways.
article_title: SARS-CoV-2 variants induce increased inflammatory gene expression but
  reduced interferon responses and heme synthesis as compared with wild type strains.
