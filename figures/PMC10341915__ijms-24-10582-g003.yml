caption: Predicted gene pathways of altered miRNAs in ME/CFS plasma. (a) Potential
  pathways affected by miR-127, miR-140, miR-142, miR-143, miR-150, and miR-448; miRNAs
  are represented in blue circles, target genes are represented in yellow circles,
  each blue line represents a miRNA-gene interaction. (b) Main target genes involved
  in detected pathways; the top ten target genes resulted from the analysis and the
  number of miRNAs targeting them are presented. The color code reflects the adjusted
  p-values for multiple testing (False Discovery Rate, FDR), increasing from red to
  blue. (c) Functional enrichment analysis based on WikiPathways; colors from red
  to blue of the dots represent the adjusted p-values (FDR), whereas the size of the
  dots represents the gene ratio (n° of miRNA targets found in each category/n° of
  total miRNA targets). Analyses and graphical representations were obtained using
  the MIENTURNET tool [].
