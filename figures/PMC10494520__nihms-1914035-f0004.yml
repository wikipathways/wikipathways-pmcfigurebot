figure_title: Identification of biomarkers of resistance to PI3Kβ inhibition-induced
  immunity in PTEN-deficient patient-derived xenografts (PDXs)
caption: Mice bearing PTEN-deficient PDXs were treated with AZD6482 for four days.
  Tumors were harvested and snap-frozen for RNA-Seq analysis (n = 4 tumors per condition
  for each model). a, GSEA comparing AZD6482 treatment to the vehicle control for
  each individual model. Plots show up- or down-regulation for the AZD6482-treated
  condition. b, GSEA between PDX models (vehicles only). Statistical significance
  of enrichment scores (p-values) was calculated by GSEA using a phenotype-based permutation
  test. EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; FGF, fibroblast growth factor;
  FGFR, FGF receptor; GO, gene ontology; IGF1R, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor;
