caption: A Volcano plot illustrating differential gene expression. Gray indicates
  genes with non-significant differential expression, while red and blue denote genes
  with significant differential expression. B Heatmap of differentially expressed
  genes. Red signifies relatively high expression of protein-coding genes, whereas
  blue represents relatively low expression of protein-coding genes. Enrichment analysis.
  C Differential gene enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) (NC-SH). D Enrichment
  analysis of differential genes using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathways (NC-SH). The horizontal axis represents the Enrichment Score, while the
  vertical axis represents the categories. Bubble size reflects the number of differentially
  expressed protein-coding genes, and color changes from blue to red indicate the
  significance of enrichment p-values, with larger bubbles being more significant.
  E Enrichment analysis of differential genes using Reactome pathways (NC-SH). F Enrichment
  analysis of differential genes using WikiPathways (SH-NIC).
