caption: Pathway enrichment from POAG/PACG candidate genes. The interactions of known
  and candidate genes are represented. The node represents the GO, KEGG, WikiPathways
  and REACTOME items. The size of the node represents the significance; smaller nodes
  have higher and larger nodes have lower significance. The highlighted pathway is
  labeled according to the highest significance. The color of the nodes is visualized
  on the basis of different functional groups. Panel A is the genetic network map
  from candidates genes of POAG families and panel B is the same from the PACG families.
