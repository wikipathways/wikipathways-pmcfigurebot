caption: 'GO annotation and WikiPathways analysis of DEGs. (A–C) Dot plots including
  GO molecular functions associated with the 20 most significant DEGs in the CC during
  demyelination: (A) Comparison of controls to 4-week cuprizone-treated mice, and
  from early demyelination or late demyelination to remyelination; (B) 2-week-treated
  mice compared to remyelination; (C) 4-week-treated mice compared to remyelination.
  In these graphs, dot size shows the number of DEGs for each GO function, the -log10
  of the p-value for over-represented significant GO terms is illustrated, and the
  color gradation expresses the amount of DEGs in the set divided by the total number
  of genes within the GO term. (D–H) Dot plots of the significantly expressed functions
  of WikiPathways associated with the DEGs identified in the CC (D) and OPCs after
  4 weeks of cuprizone treatment (E), and with the common DEGs identified in the CC
  and OPC analysis (F). Wikipathways associated with DEGs detected in the CC at early
  and late demyelination compared to remyelinating CC were analyzed for (G) 2-week-treated
  mice compared to remyelination and (H) 4-week-treated mice compared to remyelination.
  In these graphs, the x-axis represents the number of DEGs in the differential expression
  set divided by the number of genes in the pathway. Color scale shows the adjusted
  p-value. Dot size illustrates the number of genes for each pathway.'
