caption: BMCE treatment partially restores the serum proteomic profile in PSNL mice.
  (A) Volcano plots showing the differential abundances of total proteins in BMCE-treated
  PSNL serum compared with saline-treated PSNL serum. (Bâ€“C) Network analysis of enriched
  pathways from Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
  REACTOME, and WikiPathways, shown as a connectivity map of a subset of terms selected
  with the best P-values from each cluster. Analysis was performed with all significantly
  changing DEPs (upregulated and downregulated) in BMCE-treated PSNL serum compared
  with saline-treated PSNL serum. The size of each node represents the number of DEPs
  represented within that enriched term. (B) Network plot where each node represents
  an enriched term and is colored by cluster ID, where nodes sharing the same cluster
  ID would be closer to each other. (C) The same network plot where each node is colored
  by P-value, where terms containing more genes would have a more significant P-value.
  (D) Log10 P-values and numbers of DEPs for each pathway cluster represented in the
  connectivity map. The vertical dashed line represents the position of P-value of
  0.05. n = 5 animals/group. BMCE, bone marrow cell extracts; PSNL, partial sciatic
  nerve ligation.
