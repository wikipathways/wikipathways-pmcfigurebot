caption: Proteomic analysis of the PL-dECM. (Aâ€“C) GO enrichment analysis showed the
  protein enrichment degree of cellular components, biological process, and molecular
  function of the PL-dECM. (D, E) The top 10 highly expressed proteins in the calcium-binding
  and focal adhesion categories of GO analysis. (F) Wikipathways analysis revealing
  the most relevant pathways in the PL-dECM components. (G, H) The MatrisomeDB 2.0
  database was used to analyze the relative content and category amount of extracellular
  matrix proteins in the PL-dECM. (I) The graph exhibited the relatively highly expressed
  proteins and their relative contents in different categories of extracellular matrix
  proteins.
