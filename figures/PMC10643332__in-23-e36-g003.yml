figure_title: Integrated analysis of mouse and human sequencing data. (A) GSEA plots
  of mice and humans. (B) Venn diagram illustrating the common DEGs in TECs from old
  mice and adult humans. (C) Bubble plot displaying the STRING-based analysis of functionally
  enriched pathways in TECs of old mice and adult humans. Strength indicates the logarithm
  of the ratio of the number of DEGs in the network to the number of genes expected
  to be annotated in a random network
caption: S, STRING clusters; R, reactome; G, gene ontology process; K, KEGG; W, WikiPathways;
  U, UniProt keywords; FDR, false discovery rate.
