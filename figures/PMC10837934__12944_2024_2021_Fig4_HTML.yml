caption: Pathological staining and transcriptome profiling analysis in rat model of
  kidney transplantation. (a) HE and Masson staining showed extensive mononuclear
  cell infiltration and an increased fibrosis area, respectively, in the allograft
  group. (b) The transcript per million (TPM) distribution shows the eligible transcriptome
  data between the allograft group (fibrosis) and the syngeneic allograft group (normal).
  (c) Volcano plot showing 1136 upregulated genes and 881 downregulated genes compared
  to those in the syngeneic allograft group. (d) GO analysis of the 1136 up regulated
  DEGs. (e) GO analysis of the 881 downregulated DEGs. (f) WikiPathways enrichment
  analysis of all 2017 DEGs
