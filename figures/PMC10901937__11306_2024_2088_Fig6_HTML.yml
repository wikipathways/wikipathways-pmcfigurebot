caption: Altered pathways between 22q11.2DS and TD including representative genes
  in the complement cascade, coagulation and Ca2 + signaling pathways, other psychiatric
  and autism altered protein datasets, and some of their known. The figure shows selected
  enriched genes identified by multiple pathway databases, including Reactome, Bioplanet
  and Wikipathways. Enrichment analysis was generated using the Epistemic AI platform
