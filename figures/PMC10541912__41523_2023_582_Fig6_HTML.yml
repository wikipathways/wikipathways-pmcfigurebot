figure_title: Characterization of DNA binding properties of 4 different p53 missense
  mutant proteins by ChIP-Seq
caption: a Genes that were targeted (peak detection q < 0.05) by WT and mutant p53
  proteins at the promoter region are shown as a heat map. The colors represent the
  −log10 q values. b Enriched pathways (hypergeometric test p < 0.05) in the identified
  targets of WT and mutant p53 proteins are shown as a heat map of −log10 p values.
  Representative results based on the WikiPathways pathway set are shown. c Enrichment
  of the canonical DNA binding motif of the p53 protein family in promoter regions
  for WT and mutant p53 proteins. The color represents −log10 (hypergeometric test
  q). d Invasion-correlated (Pearson’s correlation p value < 0.05) pathways that were
  enriched in target genes (hypergeometric test p value < 0.1) of WT or mutant p53
  proteins. The terms were sorted by the pathway groups (shown in left). e Enrichment
  of top known transcription factor binding motifs within identified peaks for WT
  and mutant p53 proteins. The color represents −log10 (hypergeometric test q). f
  The bar plot shows the number of de novo motifs (p < 1.0e-10) found for WT and mutant
  p53 proteins. g Enrichment profile of de novo binding motifs for WT and mutant p53
  proteins are shown. The color represents −log10 (hypergeometric test p). The detailed
  ChIP-Seq analysis results can be found in Supplementary Table .
