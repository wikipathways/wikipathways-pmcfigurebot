figure_title: Cartoon diagram illustrating potential electrical transmission along
  the proximal-distal axis of the porcine colon under vagal nerve stimulation (VNS)
  and the response mechanisms of certain neuronal/glial cell populations to VNS
caption: The enrichment ratio of the shared biological processes (BPs) between the
  top five WikiPathways and pro- or anti-inflammatory signaling (pro/anti) was calculated.
  The solid and dot lines represent cellâ€“cell interactions with and without alterations
  under VNS, respectively. Black dots represent the targeting sites. Color represents
  a log10(pro/anti) distribution from Anti (orange) to Pro (blue). Arrowheads in light
  blue and purple indicate the enrichment ratio with and without VNS, respectively.
  Pro pro-inflammation, Anti anti-inflammation.
