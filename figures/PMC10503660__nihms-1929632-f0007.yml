caption: IL-33â€“activated eosinophils induce transcriptome changes in rested ILC2s.
  ILC2s and eosinophils were cultured for 24 hours as in , then isolated for RNA-Seq.
  Comparisons were made between ILC2s cultured alone or with IL-33 Act EOS. (A) The
  1000 most variable genes are represented in a hierarchical clustering heat map.
  (B) Parametric gene set enrichment (aka PGSEA) of WikiPathways. (C) MFA plot of
  differentially expressed genes that are FDR < 0.05 and absolute log2-fold < 1. Representative
  genes are labeled in MFA plot, and (D) upregulated DEG genes are shown in a table.
  (E) DEG genes that were FDR < 0.05 log2-fold > 1 were used to identify significant
  GO enrichment pathways. DEG genes that mapped to Reactome Immune System and Signal
  Transduction data sets were analyzed in ToppGene to identify enrichment in significant
  functional pathways that were both up- and downregulated between ILC2s with and
  without IL-33 Act EOS. MFA, Multifactor analysis.
