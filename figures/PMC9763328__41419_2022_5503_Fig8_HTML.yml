figure_title: Detection of miR-378 target genes and related autophagy and cancer progression
  signaling via bioinformatics analysis
caption: 'A Target genes of miR-378i and miR-378a-3p were predicted using the TargetScan
  (green) and DIANA-microT (red) databases and are shown as Venn plots. B The identified
  target genes were organized into a gene regulatory network using Cytoscape. Red
  circles: miR-378a-3p and miR-378i; red lines represent the connection of the specific
  miR to its corresponding target genes. To further highlight associations between
  miR-378i and miR-378a-3p target genes and signaling chains, the comprehensive gene
  set enrichment analysis web server Enrichr (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/enrich)
  was used to analyze gene sets in different databases. C Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
  analysis was performed. BP biological process, CC cellular component, MF molecular
  function. D Likewise, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis
  was conducted. E The WikiPathways database of biological pathways was screened.'
