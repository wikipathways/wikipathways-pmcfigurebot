caption: Functional enrichment analysis of the transcripts (A) and genes (B) differentially
  expressed between normal and PML samples. Gene sets were obtained from the WikiPathways
  resource [], and the 15 most enriched gene sets are visualized. GeneRatio is the
  fraction of differentially expressed genes in the pathway of interest, contributing
  to the enrichment signal. False-discovery rate (FDR) is the adjusted p-value of
  the enrichment significance.
