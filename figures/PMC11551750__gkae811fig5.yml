caption: 'A NRF2-PARP1 axis connects redox homeostasis to replication fork integrity.
  (A) Heatmap showing the Pearson correlation coefficient (r value) of RRM2B gene
  expression (log2 normalized) against an antioxidant gene signature for 12 TCGA transcriptome
  datasets (STAD: Stomach Adenocarcinoma; PRAD: Prostate Adenocarcinoma; BRCA: Breast
  Invasive Carcinoma; PAAD: Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma; UCS: Uterine Carcinosarcoma;
  SARC: Sarcoma; ESCA: Oesophageal Carcinoma; SKCM: Skin Cutaneous Melanoma; KIRC:
  Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma; KICH: Kidney Chromophobe; HNSC: Head and Neck
  Squamous Cell Carcinoma; OV: Ovarian Carcinoma). A negative r value indicates that
  the variables tested are inversely related. All results are significant at P< 0.0001.
  (B), The Pearson correlation coefficients of the expression of each gene in the
  antioxidant gene signature (log2 normalized, 125 genes) against RRM2B expression
  (log2 normalized) were calculated across 12 TCGA datasets (as described in A). Tumor
  samples n = 4964. A hierarchical heatmap was constructed to depict the Pearson correlation
  coefficient (r value). All results achieved significance at P< 0.001. (C) Genes
  are clustered in (D), according to their Pearson correlation coefficient (r value).
  STRING enrichment analysis (WikiPathways) of genes identified in cluster III in
  (B) sorted by enrichment strength, Log10(observed/expected), with false discovery
  rate and observed gene count indicated. Similar gene enrichment analysis was performed
  using a p53 gene signature instead of RRM2B gene expression (). (D) Pearson correlation
  coefficient (r value) between RRM2B gene expression and p53 gene signature score
  that predicts for wildtype p53 functionality were calculated across 12 TCGA transcriptome
  datasets used in (A) and (B) (tumor samples n = 4964). (E) Venn diagram showing
  overlap of antioxidant genes that are enriched with reduced RRM2B gene expression
  or reduced p53 gene signature score, identified by their Pearson correlation coefficient
  (r value). Pearson correlation coefficient of r←0.1 (P< 0.001) was used as a cut-off.
  Four NRF2 target antioxidant genes are commonly enriched (G6PD, PRDX1, PRDX6 and
  TXN1). (F) Schematic of the fork degradation assay in HCT116 parental (WT) and p53KO
  cells pretreated with an NRF2 inhibitor, ML385 (30 μM, 48 h). Cells were subjected
  to HU (2 mM) in the presence of ATRi (2 μM). IdU/CIdU ratios for individual replication
  forks plotted. Representative of n = 3 experiments. (G) Schematic of the fork degradation
  assay in HCT116 parental (WT) and p53KO cells transfected with NRF2-targeted siRNAs.
  Cells were subjected to HU (2 mM) in the presence of ATRi (2 μM). IdU/CIdU ratios
  for individual replication forks plotted. Representative of n = 3 experiments. (H)
  Schematic of the fork degradation assay in HCT116 parental (WT) stably transfected
  with shp53 or empty vector (EV) control. As in (G), cells were transfected with
  NRF2-targeted siRNAs. Cells were subjected to HU (2 mM) in the presence of ATRi
  (2 μM). IdU/CIdU ratios for individual replication forks plotted. Representative
  of n = 3 experiments. (I) Total PARylation in HCT116 (WT) and p53KO cells transfected
  with NRF2-targeted siRNAs was analysed by western blot using an anti-PAR antibody
  (CST, 83732). Total PARP1, NRF2, G6PD and p53 protein expression was also detected
  in immunoblots. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (J) HCT116 parental (WT) cells
  transfected with siNRF2 were immunostained for total PAR (anti-PAR [10H] antibody,
  Abcam ab14459). Mean PAR intensity per nucleus were quantified and plotted. n ≥
  200 in each condition (mean ± SD; n = 3; two-tailed t-test). (K) HCT116 parental
  (WT) cells were treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF, NRF2 activator) at 10 or 30
  μM for 12 h. Total PARylation, G6PD and γH2AX protein expression analysed by western
  blot. GAPDH used as a loading control. (L) Schematic of the fork degradation assay
  in HCT116 parental (WT) and p53KO cells pretreated with Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF)
  (10 or 30 μM, 12 h). Cells were subjected to HU (2 mM) in the presence or absence
  of ATRi (2 μM). IdU/CIdU ratios for individual replication forks plotted. Representative
  of n = 3 experiments. In (F), (G), (H) and (l) red horizontal bar represents mean
  of CldU/IdU ratios; P value was calculated from n ≥ 100 DNA fibers using Mann–Whitney
  test (P< 0.0001 ****; ns = not significant). Data Representative of n = 3 independent
  experiments. Western blots in (I) and (J) were repeated independently at least three
  times with similar results. GAPDH was used as loading control.'
