caption: 'Transcriptomics and proteomics showing the complement cascade is activated
  in POCD mouse model. (A) GO analysis of DEGs between the control and surgery group.
  (B) KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs between the control and surgery group. (C) Wikipathways
  analysis of DEGs between the control and surgery group. (D) Heatmap showing the
  DEGs related to the complement cascade between the control and surgery group. Each
  column represents an individual mouse. (E) Validation of the DEGs in D using qPCR
  (n = 4–5 mice per group). (F) KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed
  proteins (DEPs) between the control and surgery group. (G-H) Immunoblot analysis
  of C3 and C1q expression levels at different timepoints after surgery (1, 3 and
  7 DPO). (G) Representative blots using 2 mice from each group. (H) Statistics of
  4 mice per group. (I) Double-immunostaining of GFAP (green) and C3 (red) in the
  hippocampal CA1 region from the control and surgery group (n = 3 mice per group).
  Scale bars: 100 μm. Data in bar graph are presented as mean ± SEM. * P < 0.05, **
  P < 0. 01, *** P < 0.001, ns, not significant; by two-tailed t-test or one-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s post hoc test'
