caption: Pathway analysis. A Class-specific altered pathways. i. ORA analysis performed
  with PathVisio, starting from the class-specific inhibition response. Asterisks
  indicate pathways changed in the pathway analysis of the intersect gene list (Figure
  B). Cuts-off of significance include Z-score > 2 and permuted p value < 0.05. Red
  boxes indicate pathways below the threshold of significance. ii. ORA analysis performed
  with IPA, starting from the class-specific inhibition response, cuts-off of significance
  include absolute activation z-score > 2 and p value < 0.05. B Compound-specific
  altered pathways. Displayed pathways are induced from at least four compounds. i.
  Compound-specific pathway analysis performed with Pathvisio, cuts-off of significance
  include Z-Score > 2 and permuted p value < 0.05. ii. Compound-specific pathway analysis
  performed with IPA, cuts-off of significance include p value < 0.05
