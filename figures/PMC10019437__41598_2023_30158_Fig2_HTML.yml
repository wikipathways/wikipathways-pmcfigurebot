caption: Pathway enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes. (a) 93 differentially
  expressed genes at day 0 between COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors were evaluated
  for enrichment of pathways. (b) 290 differentially expressed genes at day 7 between
  COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors were evaluated for enrichment of pathways.
  GeneOntology (Biological Processes), KEGG, Reactome, and Wikipathways were used
  in this over-representation analysis for both DEG sets. Only pathways with an adjusted
  p-value ≤ 0.05 for enrichment are shown.
