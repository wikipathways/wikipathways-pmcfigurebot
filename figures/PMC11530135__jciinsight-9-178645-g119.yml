caption: GSEA reveals pathways altered in mitochondrial disease. Volcano plot of GSEA
  in groups versus controls in (A) All Mitochondrial Patients (MitoPatients); (B)
  CI; (C) MtGenExp, and (D) CIV. Circle diameter denotes set size while color denotes
  annotation source (blue, GO:BP; red, Reactome; green, WikiPathways). Differentially
  enriched gene sets are labeled according to a normalized enrichment score (NES)
  > 1.3 or < –1.3 and a q value < 0.05 (presented as –Log10q value). Enriched gene
  sets were further investigated and protein heatmaps were prepared for (E) Mitochondrial
  Complex I Assembly (WP4324); (F) Mitochondrial Complex IV Assembly (WP4922); (G)
  Response to External Stimulus (GO:0032101), including Regulation of Inflammatory
  Response (GO:0050727); (H) Arachidonic Acid Metabolism (R-HSA-2142753); (I) Glycosphingolipid
  Metabolism (R-HSA-1660662); (J) Metabolism of Noncoding RNA (R-HSA-194441) and (K)
  Mitochondrial Protein Import (R-HSA-1268020). Individual gene set proteins are colored
  by Log2 FC versus average control (Log2FC) and further annotated with (+) if significantly
  differentially expressed (adj. P < 0.05) in the specific comparison.
