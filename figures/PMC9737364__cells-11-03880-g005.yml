caption: DUSP4 overexpression downregulates DEGs in female 5xFAD, notably in ERK/MAPK,
  interferon, neuroinflammation and PD-L1/PD-1 pathways. (A,B) Volcano plot representation
  of female 5xFAD-GFP vs. WT-GFP, and 5xFAD-DUSP4 vs. 5xFAD-GFP. n = 5 mice per group.
  Threshold for DEGs represented is FDR < 0.05 (orange and blue dots). Enrichment
  analysis, by wikipathways mouse, of DEGs from (C) female 5xFA-GFP vs. WT-GFP, and
  (D) female 5xFAD-DUSP4 vs. 5xFAD-GFP. (E) Venn diagram shows the number of DEGs
  shared in common among 5xFAD-GFP vs. WT-GFP and 5xFAD-DUSP4 vs. 5xFAD-GFP. (F) Canonical
  pathways predicted by IPA based on DEGs of female 5xFAD-DUSP4 vs. 5xFAD-GFP, and
  5xFAD-GFP vs. WT-GFP. (G) DEGs that are involved in ERK/MAPK, interferon, neuroinflammation
  and PD-L1/PD-1 pathways predicted by IPA. (H) RT-PCR analysis of the genes in the
  predicted pathways, n = 4–6 mice per group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  **** p < 0.0001; ns nonsignificant. (I) Crosstalk between neurons and microglia
  via an unknown mechanism (?) is postulated to be impacted by neuronal DUSP4 overexpression,
  resulting in suppression of neuroinflammatory and IFNγ signaling (red dashed line)
  in microglia, leading to reduced expression of cytokines, chemokines and IFNγ. (Created
