caption: Data and workflow overview. (A) Muscle biopsies were collected from two healthy
  female donors. Fibers were processed using one pot in-solution digestion in a 384-well
  plate, and data were acquired by DIA-PASEF on a Bruker timsTOF SCP. Proteins were
  quantified using library-free search with DIA-NN against the whole human proteome.
  Clustering allowed for visualization of similarly grouped fibers. Top ranked proteins
  distinguishing clusters were then used to understand biological pathways. (B) Number
  of proteins quantified per fiber. (C) Ten proteins with highest percent of total
  counts in each fiber. (D) WikiPathways term enrichment analysis summary of all 744
  proteins identified in any fiber. (E) Number of peptides quantified per minute across
  binned mean retention times (RT). (F) Extracted ion chromatogram showing a typical
  full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 5.2 s for example peptide KDFELNALNAR. (G)
  RT standard deviation in minutes across binned mean RTs.
