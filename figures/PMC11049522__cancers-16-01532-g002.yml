caption: Knockdown of KMT9α affects expression of proliferation- and migration-related
  genes in MIBC cell lines. (A) Pie chart showing the number of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in CAL-29 (6122) and 5637 (6296) cells upon siRNA-mediated knockdown
  of KMT9α (siKMT9α) with the number of upregulated and downregulated genes (p < 1
  × 106). Gene expression changes were determined in comparison with cells treated
  with a control siRNA (siCtrl). (B) Venn diagram showing overlap and number of DEGs
  (3657) in CAL-29 and 5637 cells upon knockdown of KMT9α (p < 1 × 106). The value
  in brackets (3245) gives the number of DEGs that are deregulated in the same direction
  (up or down) in both cell lines. (C) Enriched gene sets for GO biological processes
  (top) and WikiPathways (bottom) obtained for the 3245 commonly deregulated genes.
  (D) Venn diagram showing overlap and number of downregulated genes (1581) in CAL-29
  and 5637 cells upon knockdown of KMT9α (p < 1 × 106). (E) Enriched gene sets for
  GO biological processes for these 1581 commonly downregulated genes. (F,G) Heat
  maps displaying relative mRNA levels of genes involved in (F) “regulation of cell
  cycle” (GO:0051726) or (G) “regulation of cell migration” (GO:0030334) in 5637 cells
  treated with siCtrl or siKMT9α. (H) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of mRNA
  expression for selected genes presented in (F,G) after knockdown of KMT9α. Data
  represent means + standard deviation. Statistical significance was evaluated by
  a two-tailed t test (* p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001), n = 3. (I) Western
  blots showing protein expression of KMT9α, EGFR, and AKT1 in 5637 and CAL-29 cells
  after transfection with siCtrl, siKMT9α#1, or siKMT9α#2. Western blots were performed
  with the indicated antibodies. Tubulin or GAPDH served as controls. The intensity
  of each protein band was quantified by densitometry and normalized to the intensity
  of the house keeping gene. The siCtrl value was set to 1. (J) Real-time proliferation
  of 5637 cells (left) after treatment with DMSO, 3 µM, or 10 µM Erlotinib and CAL-29
  cells (right) after treatment with DMSO, 10 µM, or 30 µM Erlotinib. (I) The original
  Western blots with molecular weight markers and original data of densitometry scans
  are presented in .
