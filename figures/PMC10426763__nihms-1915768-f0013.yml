caption: (A) Gene set z-scores for top gene markers for each cell state plotted in
  the UMAP embedding. (B) Enrich GO using compareclusters from cluster Prolifer across
  macrophage cell states. P-value calculated using Fisher exact test. (C) WikiPathways
  enriched in cardiac recovery. P-value calculated using Fisher exact test. (D) Paired
  comparison of Mac 2 cluster composition at patient level split by U and RR group
  from biologically independent samples. (E) DoRothEA TF enrichment analysis in U-post
  and RR-post zoomed in on some key differentially enriched TFs. (F) Overlap between
  Runx1 target genes and DE genes between U-pre and RR-pre with heatmap of respective
  genes split by condition.
