figure_title: Functional groups in ClueGO overview
caption: The pie charts present functional groups for analyzed genes, based on GO,
  KEGG, Reactome and WikiPathways annotation by ClueGO Cytoscape plug-in, then clustered
  into STRING action enriched (a), combined score (b), database score (c), and textmining
  (d) categories. The name of the group is given by the group leading term (the most
  significant term in the group). The group sections correlate with the number of
  the terms included in the group. Network structure of functional groups is calculated
  on kappa Score, which shows the relationships between the terms based on their overlapping
  genes.
