figure_title: Machine learning predicts proteomic changes from metabolomic changes
caption: 'a, Scheme showing the ML task of predicting proteins from metabolomic data
  measured in parallel by SMAD. b, Overall performance of all proteins true versus
  ML predicted values. c,d,e, Examples of three of the most well predicted proteins
  from different pathways: TPIS from glycolysis, DHB4 from fatty acid oxidation, and
  RSSA from the ribosome. f, plot of the Spearman rho between true versus predicted
  protein quantities for all 450 proteins. Red indicates statistically significantly
  predicted proteins according to a Bonferroni corrected p-value from Spearman correlation
  analysis. g, WikiPathways term enrichment analysis of the 54 significant proteins
  from (f).'
