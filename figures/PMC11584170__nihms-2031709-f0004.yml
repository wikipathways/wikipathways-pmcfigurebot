caption: SLU-PP-332 induces acute aerobic exercise genetic program in skeletal muscles.
  Results from RNA-seq studies from the gastrocnemius or quadricep muscles of mice
  treated with vehicle or SLU-PP-332. (A) Volcano plot illustrating differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR > 0.05, | FC| > 1.5) from the quadriceps of SLU-PP-332-treated
  mice. Muscles were collected 3 h post final dose of a 10-day dosing regimen 50 mg/kg
  b.i.d. (B) Volcano plot illustrating differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR
  > 0.05, |FC| > 1.5) from the gastrocnemius muscle of SLU-PP-332-treated mice. Muscles
  were collected 3 h post final dose of a 10-day dosing regimen 50 mg/kg b.i.d. (C)
  Venn diagram representing the overlap of DEGs from the two muscle types shown in
  panels (A) and (B). (D, E) Pathway analysis of DEGs in quadricep and gastrocnemius
  muscles after treatment with SLU-PP-332 in mice. The significantly (p < 0.05) regulated
  pathways shared in both muscle types are listed for KEGG pathways (D) and Wikipathways
  (E). (F) Venn diagram illustrating the overlap of SLU-PP-332 DEGs and DEGs identified
  in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice subjected to acute aerobic exercise (see text
  for details). Fisher’s exact test was performed to determine significance. (G) Venn
  diagram illustrating the overlap of SLU-PP-332 DEGs and DEGs identified in the quadricep
  muscle of lean humans subjected to acute aerobic exercise (see text for details).
  Fisher’s exact test was performed to determine significance. (H) Ddit4 (upper panel)
  and Slc25c25 expression (lower panel) from quadriceps from mice treated with vehicle
  (gray triangle), SLU-PP-332 (50 mg/kg, i.p., red triangle), SLU-PP-332 in combination
  of 45 min of running (green circle), or no treatment (black circle). Mice were euthanized
  as indicated 1, 3, or 6 h after treatment (n = 6 per group). (I) DDIT4 protein expression
  from quadriceps from mice treated with SLU-PP-332 (50 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice were euthanized
  as indicated 1 or 3 h after treatment (n = 3 per group). The bar graph represents
  the quantification of expression. p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p
  < 0.0001.
