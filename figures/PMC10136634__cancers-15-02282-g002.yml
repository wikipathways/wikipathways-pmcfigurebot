caption: Kaiso represses the expression of several immune genes, including THBS1.
  (A). Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes from PanCancer Nanostring
  Immune Profiling showed that there were fewer immune genes expressed in sh–Kaiso
  cells as compared to control sh-Scr cells. (B). Cytoscape analysis shows that genes
  interact through the chemokine signaling pathway, the cytokine–cytokine receptor
  pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and the NOD–like receptor signaling pathway,
  and the NF–kappa B signaling pathway was downregulated in sh-Kaiso cells as compared
  to sh-Scr cells. (C). A Venn diagram shows the association of immune genes between
  genes that were upregulated in AA exosomes and genes downregulated in sh-Kaiso cells
  (identified by color code). A total of 31 genes, including CD47 and TGFB1, were
  common genes among these two groups. (D). Kaiso-depleted cells showed significantly
  lower expression of CD47 with significantly higher expression of THBS1 as compared
  to sh–Scr cells. The statistical method used was the two–tailed paired t test. (E).
  Nanostring immune profiling showed that Kaiso repressed several genes, including
  THBS1, based on the downregulated gene expression in sh–Scr cells.
