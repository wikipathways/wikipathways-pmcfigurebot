caption: Exploring the biological functions of SS31. (A) Volcano plot visualization
  of the differentially-expressed genes in response to SS31 treatment. (B, C, D, E)
  The results of GO, KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways pathway enrichment analysis
  after RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). (F, G) The relative mRNA expression level of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) after
  treatment with SS31. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). **, p < 0.01 compared
  with the control group, and ***, p < 0.001 compared with the control group.
