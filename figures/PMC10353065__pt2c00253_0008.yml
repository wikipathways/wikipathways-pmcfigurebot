caption: Transcriptomic profiling of down-regulated targets of Analog 523. A) Venn-Diagram
  of downregulated genes following Analog 523 treatment for 4 hours and 12 hours in
  MDA-MB-468 AhR-expressing but not AhR KO cells. Represented genes exhibited fold
  changes greater than 2 and had adjusted p-values <0.05. B) Bubble plot showing enriched
  Hallmark Gene Sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MolSigDB) after 4- and
  12 hours treatment with Analog 523. DEGS analyzed exhibited fold changes greater
  than 1.5 and adjusted p-values <0.05. C) Bubble plot displaying enriched pathways
  (WikiPathways) following 4- and 12 hours treatment with Analog 523. DEGS analyzed
  exhibited absolute fold changes greater than 1.5 and adjusted p-values <0.05.
