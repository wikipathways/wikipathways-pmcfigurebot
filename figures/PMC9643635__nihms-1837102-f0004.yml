figure_title: Pathway analysis of phagocytic cells in the brain during S. aureus craniotomy
  infection
caption: C57BL/6J mice (n=25) were sacrificed at day 3 following craniotomy infection
  with a S. aureus-dsRed strain, whereupon viable phagocytic (dsRed+) vs. non-phagocytic
  (dsRedâˆ’) CD45+ cells were purified from the brain by FACS for scRNA-seq. The heat
  map depicts significantly enriched pathways in cells from each brain cluster that
  phagocytosed S. aureus (dsRed+) in comparison to all other clusters. Significance
  of the normalized enrichment scores (NES) for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  is denoted (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; and ****, p < 0.0001). H=
  Hallmark pathway; K= KEGG pathway; R= Reactome pathway; WP= WikiPathways; N= NABA
  pathway.
