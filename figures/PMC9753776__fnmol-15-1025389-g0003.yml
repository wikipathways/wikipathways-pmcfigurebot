caption: Venn diagrams show how differentially expressed gene transcripts overlap
  between statistical comparisons performed for (A) amygdala regions, (B) genotypes,
  and (C) environments. (D) Large numbers of functional gene sets were found when
  comparing portions of the amygdala. GO, gene ontology; BP, biological process; CC,
  cellular component; MF, molecular function; KEGG, pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; REAC, Reactome pathways; WP, WikiPathways.
