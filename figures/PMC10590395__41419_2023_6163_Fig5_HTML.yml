figure_title: CSF2 induces Notch1 ubiquitination in MSCs
caption: A Statistical representation of differentially expressed genes in control
  and CSF2-transfected MSCs. B Cluster diagram illustrating the grouping of differentially
  expressed genes. C KEGG analysis of the distribution of differentially expressed
  genes. D Chord chart analysis of the top10 genes based on the WikiPathways database.
  E Bubble plots depicting the enrichment of the top 20 downregulated genes according
  to WikiPathways. F Western blot analysis of Notch1 protein expression. G Western
  blot analysis of Notch1 protein levels in MSCs transfected with increasing doses
  of CSF2, with or without MG132 treatment. H CHX assay for the protein stability
  of Notch1 in control and CSF2 knockdown P-MSCs. I Assessment of Notch1 ubiquitination
  in ubiquitin (Ub)-transfected and MG132-treated MSCs (control and CSF2 overexpression)
  and P-MSCs (control and CSF2 knockdown). The immunoprecipitated ubiquitinated Notch1
  proteins were detected using Notch1 and ubiquitin antibodies.
