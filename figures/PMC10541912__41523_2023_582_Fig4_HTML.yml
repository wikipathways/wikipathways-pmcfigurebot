figure_title: Transcriptomic profiles of mutant p53-expressing MCF10A cell lines and
  phenotype-associated pathways
caption: For the top 15 phenotype-associated pathways for each phenotype selected
  based on the minimum rank in GSEA, ssGSEA, and PLSR results, the percentile ranks
  are displayed as heat maps. The pathways discussed in texts are color-coded, as
  indicated. KP KEGG pathways, RP Reactome pathways, WP WikiPathways, and OS MSigDB
  Oncogenic Signatures. RNA-Seq and pathway analysis results are in Supplementary
  Table .
