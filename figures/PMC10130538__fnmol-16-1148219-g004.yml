caption: 'Lesion leads to pathway-specific transcriptomic changes in the hippocampal
  CA1 region. (A) Volcano plot illustrating differential gene expression in the CA1
  region of non-lesioned cultures vs. 3 days following SCL (ncontrol = 5 cultures,
  nSCL = 4 cultures). The significance threshold [padj. < −log10(0.05)] is indicated
  by a dashed line. Significantly regulated genes are marked in orange and the top-10
  regulated genes are labeled. (B) Volcano plot illustrating differential gene expression
  in the CA1 region of control cultures vs. 3 days following ECL (ncontrol = 5 cultures,
  nECL = 4 cultures). The significance threshold [padj. < −log10(0.05)] is indicated
  by a dashed line. Significantly regulated genes are marked in orange and the top-10
  regulated genes are labeled. (C) VENN-diagram to illustrate commonalities and differences
  in ECL-and SCL-induced differential gene expression. Although a substantial amount
  of commonly regulated genes could be identified, lesion-specificity became evident.
  (D) XY-plot of log2FC values from differentially expressed genes in both groups
  (‘common’). Notably, we exclusively found concordantly up- (red) and downregulated
  (blue) genes. (E) Functional enrichment analysis of common differentially expressed
  genes using the web-based g:Profiler platform [gene ontologies: CC - cellular compartment
  (TOP-6), MG - molecular function (TOP-6), and WP - wikipathways (all enrichments
  illustrated)]. (F) Functional enrichment analysis of lesion-specific differentially
  expressed genes. Notably, enrichment of differentially expressed synaptic gene sets
  was exclusively found after ECL.'
