caption: Screening pathways associated with cellular senescence during COVID-19 infection.
  (A) The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly positively correlated with
  cellular senescence, among which MAPK signaling pathway was the most relevant (r
  = .999, p < .001). (B) The top 20 pathways that were significantly positively correlated
  with MAPK signaling pathways are similar to those related to cellular senescence.
  (C) Cellular senescence and MAPK signaling pathways are roughly consistent with
  cell cycle-related pathways. (D) The correlation of cellular senescence with GO
  gene sets, KEGG pathways, and WIKIPATHWAYS pathways in COVID-19 group. (E) The correlation
  of cellular senescence with GO gene sets. KEGG pathways, and WIKIPATHWAYS pathways
  in the Control group. (F) The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were negatively correlated
  with cellular senescence (r < −.8, p < .001). These pathways mainly function in
  cholesterol and testosterone synthesis, as well as glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism.
  (G) COVID-19 were significantly negatively correlated with MAPK signaling pathway
  (r < −.8, p < .001), and their main enrichment pathways were similar to those related
  to cellular senescence (H) Cellular senescence and MAPK signaling pathway were roughly
  consistent with testosterone synthesis, cholesterol synthesis and glycolysis pathway.
