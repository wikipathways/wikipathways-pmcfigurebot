figure_title: TMEM232 deficiency leads to the accumulation of ribosomal proteins in
  mouse testis
caption: A Bar graph of the pathway enrichment for upregulated proteins in Tmem232−/−
  spermatozoa identified via proteomic analysis using the Metascape database. Only
  significant GO terms (P < 0.05) are shown in rows. Terms with the prefix “R-HSA”
  are from the Reactome, the prefix “GO” from the Gene Ontology consortium, and the
  prefix “WP” from the WikiPathways. B Number of significantly upregulated or downregulated
  ribosomal subunit proteins identified using proteomic analysis. C Western blotting
  analysis revealed the protein levels of large and small ribosomal subunits, respectively,
  in the testes of Tmem232+/+ (n = 2) and Tmem232−/− (n = 2) male mice at 2-months-old.
  α-Tubulin served as a loading control. The representative image of biological duplicates
  is shown. D Immunofluorescent staining (IF) of ribosomal proteins RPL3 and RPS6
  on frozen sections of Tmem232+/+ (n = 3) and Tmem232−/− (n = 3) male mice testis.
  Blue, DAPI; green, RPL3 or RPS6. A detailed explanation of the schematic diagram
  is given in the text. Scale bars, 20 μm. E ATP levels were significantly decreased
  in Tmem232−/− mouse sperm compared with those in the controls. Tmem232+/+, 6.78 ± 0.18;
  Tmem232−/−, 2.92 ± 0.56. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. **** indicates P < 0.0001;
  n = 3 for each genotype. F Fluorescence microscopy observation of sperm obtained
  from Tmem232+/+ (n = 2) and Tmem232−/− (n = 2) male mice after JC-1 staining, DiOC6,
  or Mito-Tracker staining. Scale bars, 100 μm.
