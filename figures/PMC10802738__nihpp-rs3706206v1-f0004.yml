figure_title: Functional enrichment analysis of APOE-dependent protein-protein interaction
  partners
caption: a) A scheme of the PPI partners selection, where first degree partners of
  the APOE-dependent proteins were extracted from the InWeb database. b-c) Enrichment
  of selected Gene Ontology terms for the PPI partner proteins shown as b) dotplot
  and c) gene-concept network. d-e)Enrichment of top seven unique Wikipathways shown
  as d) dotplot and e)gene-concept network.
