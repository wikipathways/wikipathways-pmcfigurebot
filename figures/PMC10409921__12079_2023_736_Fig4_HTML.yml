caption: Representation of the protein phosphosites that overlapped with prior studies
  on VEGF-A signaling. VEGF-A induced protein phosphorylation in HUVECs were extracted
  and incorporated in our previous model (Abhinand et al. ). The differentially phosphorylated
  proteins are highlighted, (violet (hypo-phosphorylation) and dark red (hyper-phosphorylation))
  with their phosphorylation site information using theÂ Pathvisio tool

  an insight into early signaling events associated with angiogenesis.'
