caption: 'Canonical NF-κB signaling pathways from TLRs, TNFα and IL-1. The following
  pathways were deduced from Wikipathways (via Cytoscape) and manually curated and
  merged in Inkscape: TNF alpha signaling pathway; IL-1. signaling pathway and Toll-like
  receptor signaling pathway. The Cytoscape file with the three pathways is available
  upon request to the authors.'
