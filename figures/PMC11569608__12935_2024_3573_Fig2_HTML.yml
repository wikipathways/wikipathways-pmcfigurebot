caption: 'Functional enrichment analysis using g: Profiler software (version e94_eg41_p11)
  and western blot analysis. (A) The significantly enriched terms according to the
  GO and WikiPathways (WP) databases. Statistical significance was determined using
  a threshold of p < 0.05. (B-C) The normalized abundance values were derived from
  Progenesis QI for Proteomics software, which quantifies proteins on the basis of
  peptide ion signal peak intensity. The criteria for significance included a p value < 0.05,
  a q value < 0.05, and a fold change (FC) ≥ 2. (D) Western blot analysis of phospho-LAT1
  (pLATS1) and LATS1 in lysates from three representative xenograft tumor samples
  from treated and control groups. β-actin served as a loading control. Western blot
  quantifications were performed with ImageJ software. Densitometric analysis values
  are reported as ratios relative to the corresponding β-actin levels. The graph represents
  the means +/- SD of the values for pLATS1 and LATS1 in treated and control groups.

  into the antitumor effects of valproic acid plus simvastatin combination in a prostate
  cancer xenograft model associated with downmodulation of YAP/TAZ signaling.
