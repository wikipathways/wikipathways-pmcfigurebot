caption: Functional enrichment analysis with g:Profiler of DMRs obtained by segmenting
  the genome in hypermethylated and hypomethylated domains for two treatments (stimulated
  and non-stimulated animals). Manhattan plot of g:Profiler enrichment results obtained
  for unmerged (a) and merged (b) conditions. GO (Molecular Function – MF, red colour;
  Biological Process – BP, orange colour; and Cellular Component – CC, green colour),
  KEGG (pink colour), Reactome (navy blue colour), and WikiPathways (light blue colour)
  databases were used for the analysis. Only terms with a p value < 0.05 are shown
  in the graph. The table below shows the most representative terms for each analysis
  group (where applicable), and the statistical value for each term is indicated by
  the −Log10 (p value).
