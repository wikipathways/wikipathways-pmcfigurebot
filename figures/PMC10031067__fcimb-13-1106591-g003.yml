caption: Nef-mediated changes in ubiquitination of cellular proteins that directly
  interact with Nef or the UPS. (A) Nef-mediated ubiquitination fold change in proteins
  that directly interact with Nef. Twenty-three of the 325 cellular proteins identified
  in  directly interact with Nef, according to the data collected from the NIH GENE
  database (https://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/gene). The fold changes in ubiquitination
  in the presence of Nef range from 6.8-fold decrease to a 4.68-fold increase, with
  greater color intensity corresponding to larger fold changes. The fold changes associated
  with cellular proteins for which Nef up-regulated ubiquitination are depicted in
  green, while those with down-regulated ubiquitination are in red. (B) Nef-mediated
  ubiquitination fold changes in proteins that directly interact with the UPS. Fifteen
  of the 325 cellular proteins identified in  directly interact with UPS, according
  to the data collected from the WikiPathways database (https://www.wikipathways.org/).
  The fold changes in ubiquitination range from a 5.94-fold decrease to a 10.12-fold
  increase. The same color coding was used in both panels (A, B).
