figure_title: snRNA-seq analysis from human muscle identifies 3 FAP populations
caption: a Violin plots of logcounts values from well-known marker genes of FAPs (PDGFRA,
  DCN and CD34) and adipocytes (PLIN1, PPARG and ADIPOQ), color-coded by the identified
  subpopulations. b TSNE plot of FAP and adipocyte populations from human muscle,
  color-coded by the identified subpopulations. c TSNE plots of expression levels
  of marker genes from the different subpopulations, color-coded by logcounts values.
  d Dot plots showing upregulated or downregulated pathways from GSEA of FAPs 1 vs
  FAPs 2 (left panel), FAPs 1 vs FAPs 3 (middle panel) or FAPs 2 vs FAPs 3 (right
  panel). X-axis indicates the normalized enrichment score (NES) for each pathway.
  Color and size of the dots indicate adjusted p-values (FDR). Significant values
  are delimited by the red dashed line (Adjusted p < 0.05 or -log10(adjusted p-value)
  >1.3). e, f Bar plots showing average Z-score of GSVA of adipogenesis pathways from
  Hallmark (MsigDB) (e) and WikiPathways databases (f). Color-coded by identified
  FAPs subpopulations. ***p < = 0.001, ****p < = 0.0001.
