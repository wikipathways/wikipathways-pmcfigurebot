caption: 'Pathway enrichment analyses highlighting distinct metabolic and cellular
  responses in sepsis compared to healthy controls. (A–F) Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) conducted on all genes between sepsis patients and healthy controls, revealing
  various pathways: (A) KEGG “Oxidative Phosphorylation” (NES = 1.627, FDR = 0.031),
  (B) WikiPathways “Oxidative Stress Response” (NES = 1.096, FDR = 0.065), (C) WikiPathways
  “Glutathione Metabolism” (NES = 1.570, FDR = 0.156), (D) KEGG “PPAR Signaling Pathway”
  (NES = −0.634, FDR = 0.057), (E) Reactome “Cellular Response to Stress” (NES = −2.422,
  FDR < 0.001), (F) KEGG “Wnt Signaling Pathway” (NES = −1.522, FDR = 0.016). (G)
  Gene Ontology (GO) analysis represented as a dot plot, illustrating various biological
  processes such as carbohydrate catabolism and glycolytic activity. The size of each
  dot indicates gene count, while the color gradient denotes the adjusted P value
  (P adj). (H) KEGG pathway analysis depicted as a dot plot, emphasizing pathways
  including HIF-1 signaling and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Each dot’s color gradient
  signifies the adjusted P value (P adj), and the size represents the number of genes
  associated with each pathway.'
