caption: 'Categorization of the differentially abundant proteins in BCa. (A) Bladder
  tissue and cancer specificity according to the data from the Human Protein Atlas,
  based on transcript mRNA detection and specificity. (B) GO annotations of proteins
  according to the Panther Classification System. (C) Enrichment analysis with STRING:
  Proteins colored in pink are expressed in the urinary system, while proteins colored
  in dark green are expressed in the human bladder. The top associated pathways according
  to the Reactome pathways database were the immune system (red) and neutrophil degranulation
  (blue), while according to WikiPathways, these were the VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway
  (green) and complement system (yellow). Carcinoma was among the top associated diseases
  (turquoise) according to the STRING database of disease-gene associations.'
