figure_title: Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) identified
  in the high-concentration MGO-treated group (1000 μM MGO) compared to control using
  DAVID
caption: a GO enrichment analysis for the categories of biological process (BP), cellular
  component (CC), and molecular function (MF); the top six enriched terms for each
  category are shown, selected based on the p values. b KEGG pathway enrichment analysis.
  c WikiPathways enrichment analysis (top 20 enriched terms are shown according to
  the p values).
