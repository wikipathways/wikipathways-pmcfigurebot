caption: The Prominent Negative Role of Cellular senescence on Androgen Synthesis
  (A) The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly negatively correlated with
  testosterone synthesis pathway, among which Go Senescence pathway was the most relevant
  (r = −.91, p < .001). (B)The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly positively
  correlated with testosterone synthesis pathway, among which Cholesterol Biosynthesis
  Pathway play an importance role in those.(C) ssGSEA score of Wp Cholesterol Biosynthesis
  Pathway, Wp Cholesterol Metabolism,testosterone synthesis pathway decreased in COVID-19.(D)
  The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly negatively correlated with cholesterol
  synthesis pathway, among which Go Senescence pathway was the most relevant (r =
  −.93, p < .001). (E) The top 20 pathways in COVID-19 were significantly positively
  correlated with cholesterol synthesis pathway. (F) These two rate-limiting enzymes
  for cholesterol synthesis decreased in COVID-19 infection (STAR, CYP11A1). (G) The
  correlation of testosterone synthesis pathway, cholesterol biosynthesis Pathway
  with GO gene sets, KEGG pathways, and WIKIPATHWAYS pathways in COVID-19 group. (H)
  The correlation of testosterone synthesis pathway, cholesterol biosynthesis Pathway
  with GO gene sets, KEGG pathways, and WIKIPATHWAYS pathways in the Control group.(I)
  The top 20 genes strong negative correlation with STAR (r < −.9, p < .05) by PPI
  and the top 20 genes strong positive correlation with STAR (r > .9, p < .05) by
  PPI. (J) The top 20 genes strong negative correlation with CYP11A1 (r < −.9, p <
  .05) by PPI and the top 20 genes strong positive correlation with CYP11A1 (r > .9,
  p < .05) by PPI. (K) Several genes implicated in cell senescence are among the top
  20 genes negatively correlated with STAR or CYP11A1.
