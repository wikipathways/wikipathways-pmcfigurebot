caption: The effect of EC treatment on the complement pathway is unique to the kidney
  but not applicable to the liver. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
  (B) WikiPathways, and (C) Rat Genome Database (RGD) pathway enrichment analyses
  of differentially expressed genes in RNA-sequencing transcriptome of livers derived
  from high dose EC-treated rats versus normal rats highlights the most affected pathways
  with significant statistical difference and high enrichment score. (D) Liver expression
  of mRNA levels (FPKM, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments
  mapped) of complement factors or regulators in EC-treated rats and control rats.
  NS, non-significance (n = 2).
