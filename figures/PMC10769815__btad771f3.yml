caption: Summarizing the result of query case 2 as a biological action, demonstrating
  the main effects of ketamine on neurotransmitter pathways. Pathways are summarized
  as their neurotransmitter and main interactions. The top panel shows the pathways
  derived from the KEGG and WikiPathways databases, while the bottom panel illustrates
  the effect of ketamine on these pathways as retrieved from KetFact.
