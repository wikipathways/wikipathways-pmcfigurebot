caption: 'a Principal component analysis (PCA) on gene sets of normoglycemic (C) and
  hyperglycemic (DM) WT and F12-/- mice kidneys. b Heatmap of the RNA-seq data showing
  the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in WT-DM and F12-/--DM mice. Each column
  represents data from an individual mouse. Color intensity represents row Z-score.
  c Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plots of the hallmark gene sets representing
  key negatively enriched pathways when comparing F12-/--DM to WT-DM kidneys. Significance
  is represented by the false discovery rate (FDR). d Bar graph representing the top
  enriched pathways based on the downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  in F12-/--DM compared to WT-DM kidneys using KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes), WikiPathways, Reactome, PID (Pathway Interaction Database), and GO (Gene
  Ontology: Biological processes) databases. The pathways were ranked by the false
  discovery rate (FDR). Source data are provided as a “Source Data” file.'
