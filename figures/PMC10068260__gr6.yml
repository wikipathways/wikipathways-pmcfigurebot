caption: The Wnt-signaling pathway is downregulated after SD at all ages but more
  dramatically at P24. Wnt-signaling pathways adapted from KEGG (mmu04310) and WikiPathways.
  Genes in blue are downregulated after SD in all ages. Genes colored in lime green
  are downregulated after SD only in P24. (For interpretation of the references to
  color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
