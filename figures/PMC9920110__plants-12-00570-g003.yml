caption: (a) Schematic representation of the biochemical processes involved in the
  aliphatic Glucosinolate Chain Elongation machinery; (b) Glucosinolate Core Biosynthesis.
  Amino acids, including elongated aliphatic methionine-derived molecules, can be
  converted to aldoximes by members of the CYP79 cytochrome P450 family to start building
  up the core glucosinolate scaffold. BCAT4—branched-chain aminotransferase 4; MAMS—methylthioalkylmalate
  synthase; IPMI—isopropylmalate isomerase; IPM-DH—isopropylmalate dehydrogenase;
  BCAT3—branched-chain aminotransferases-3; CYP79; GST; SUR1; UGT74; SOT. The pathway
  was built using the open-source software Pathvisio vs. 3.3.0.
