figure_title: Pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes between
  hypercoiled and control umbilical arteries
caption: '(A) Top 20 enriched pathways of the differentially expressed genes (PFDR
  â‰¤ 0.05) between hypercoiled and control umbilical arteries. Pathway enrichment was
  performed using four databases: GO Biological Process (2021) is displayed in red,
  BioPlanet (2019) is displayed in orange, WikiPathways Human (2021) is displayed
  in dark green, and Hallmark Molecular Signature (2020) is displayed in light blue.
  pESC, primary endometrial stromal cell; Pos. Reg., positive regulation; Neg. Reg.,
  negative regulation. (B) Network of the top five enriched pathway terms. Genes are
  colored based on their log fold change (red indicates an up-regulation, and blue
  indicates a down-regulation in hypercoiled umbilical arteries). The size of the
  pathway terms (nodes) is based on the number of genes found for each pathway.'
