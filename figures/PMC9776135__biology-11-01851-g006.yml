caption: 'Gene ontology was constructed by integrating WikiPathways, Reactome, and
  KEGG. Each node shows a pathway or term and the percentage of visible shared genes
  between pathways or terms and edges present relationships between pathways: (A)
  relationship between enriched pathways and genes in CM (core module); (B) relationship
  between enriched pathways and genes in CN (core nodes); (C) relationship between
  enriched pathways and genes in DN (driver nodes).'
