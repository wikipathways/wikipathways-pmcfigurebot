caption: 'Functional Enrichment Analysis for RTT and RTT-L Genes: (A) A gene-set-based
  enrichment analysis results for RTT (N1 = 4) and RTT-L (N2 = 58) genes together
  using the Gene Ontology (biological process), pathway databases (KEGG, REACTOME,
  and WIKIPATHWAYS) and regulatory motifs databases (transcription factors and microRNA).
  The X-axis represents the number of overlapping genes from our given gene sets in
  each enrichment term. The dot size highlights the enrichment statistics (p-values)
  for each term, and the dot color represents the source of each term in the respective
  databases. (B) The RTT and RTT-L genes are highlighted in one of the well-documented
  WikiPathways (WP4312) for Rett-syndrome-causing genes—Homo sapiens. We identified
  a total of 5 genes (highlighted in cyan color) that are part of the PPIN, which
  share common interaction with both RTT and RTT-L genes (as shown in A). Genes such
  as HDAC1 and CHD4 play a central role in the underline pathway.'
