caption: UPR response. A Graphical representation in PathVisio of the UPR pathway
  induced by CI inhibition. The log2 fold change over control is visualized on the
  left side of the data node boxes using a gradient from blue (-4) over white (0)
  to red (5). The p adj value is visualized on the right side of the data node boxes,
  yellow for p adj < 0.05. Full green node boxes indicate unchanged genes. Full gray
  node boxes indicate untested genes. B Heatmap comparing the log2 fold change over
  control of genes depicted in the UPR graphical representation that were significantly
  altered by at least one class of inhibitors, and the UPR inducer tunicamycin response
  (10 µM). C Heatmap comparing the log2 fold change over control of genes significantly
  altered in the UPR pathway induced by test compounds at reference concentrations
  and the UPR inducer tunicamycin (10 µM). In grey non-significant responses. NA represent
  excluded probes with baseMean lower than 10 reads
