figure_title: Pathway Enrichment Visualization
caption: '(a-d) Schematics of the depletion and enrichment of KOs within the (a) oxidative
  phosphorylation, (b) iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis, (c) N-glycan biosynthesis,
  (d) and sialylation pathways across both screens. Shading indicating log2FC shown
  only for significant hits (FDR<0.05). All pathways were adapted from WikiPathways.
  (a) OXPHOS subunits are shown with abridged names without accompanying prefixes
  (C I: NDUF; C II: SDH; C III: UQCR, C IV: COX; C V: ATP5) (e.g., B4 in CI is NDUFB4).
  Subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes are not included in the visualization.'
