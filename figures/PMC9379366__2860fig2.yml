caption: Mdm2 deletion in hepatocytes induced p53 activation and liver inflammation
  accompanied by hepatocyte apoptosis, SASP, and inflammatory cytokine production
  in LiKM mice. Liver samples were obtained from LiK, LiKM-hetero, and LiKM mice at
  6 weeks of age. A, Serum ALT (N = 9 per group). B, Serum caspase-3/7 activity (N
  = 6 per group). C–E, RNA-seq of the liver tissues in control (LiK) and target (LiKM)
  mice (N = 3 per group). C, Heatmap of DEGs. D, Enrichment analysis of DEGs in LiKM
  mice by PANTHER pathways and WikiPathways. Pathways noted in red showed inflammation-associated
  pathways. E, mRNA expression of inflammation-associated molecules. Genes noted in
  red showed significant expression changes (P < 0.05). F, qPCR analysis of the mRNA
  expression in whole liver tissue (N = 7–9 per group). G, qPCR analysis of the mRNA
  expression in hepatocytes and NPCs isolated from the liver (N = 7–10 per group).
  H, IHC for p53 (×400), p21 (×400), F4/80 (×200), and CD3 (×200), as well as TUNEL
  staining (×400), and SA-β-gal staining (×400) of the liver and the number of positive
  hepatocytes (N = 4–7). Arrows, positive hepatocytes. *, P < 0.05.
