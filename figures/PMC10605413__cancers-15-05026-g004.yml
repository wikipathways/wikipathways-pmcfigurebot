caption: Differential gene expression analysis between male and female patients with
  advanced CSCC. (A) Volcano plot of DEGs. Cut-off values for adjusted p-values and
  |LFCs| are 0.05 and 1, respectively. (B) Pathway over-representation analysis of
  DEGs. Analysis and visualisation conducted using the Enrichr webportal. (C) Visualisation
  of the Modulators of TCR signalling and T-cell activation pathway as per WikiPathways.
  Warmer colours indicate higher expression, and cooler colours indicate reduced expression
  in female patients. (D) Mean CD8 T-cell proportions in female and male patients
  as predicted by CybersortX.
