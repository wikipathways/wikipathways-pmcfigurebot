caption: PTB and LNTB risk associated SNP related genes enrich in different pathways.
  Pathways enriched in PTB (A) and LNTB (B) through a pathway analysis based on the
  SNPs with significant p-values. The modules obtained from JActivemodules were used
  for enrichment in ClueGO App in Cytoscape. Two metrics, %Associated genes (proportion
  of genes in the pathway from the network of all genes) and Term p-value (enrichment
  p-value) is plotted here to show the abundance of the pathway with all the input
  genes and the p-value for the GO term obtained from WikiPathways.
