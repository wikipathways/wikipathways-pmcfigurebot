caption: Gene expression analysis of macrophages isolated from the infrapatellar fat
  pads of osteoarthritis (OA) patients via NanoString. (A) Venn diagrams demonstrating
  the overlap of the differentially upregulated and downregulated genes in CD11c-CD206-
  (n = 3), CD11c+CD206- (n = 3), CD11c-CD206+ (n = 3), and CD11c+CD206+ (n = 3) macrophage
  population compared with internal negative controls. (B) The KEGG human pathway
  2021, Reactome 2023, GO biological process, and WikiPathways 2021 databases relevant
  to OA and macrophage function were identified based on differentially expressed
  genes of CD11c-CD206-, CD11c+CD206-, CD11c-CD206+, and CD11c+CD206+ macrophages.
  The Y-axis represents the pathway name, and the X-axis represents -log(adjusted
  P-value).
article_title: Infrapatellar fat pad adipose tissue-derived macrophages display a
  predominant CD11c+CD206+ phenotype and express genotypes attributable to key features
  of OA pathogenesis.
