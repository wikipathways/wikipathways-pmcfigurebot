caption: Lipid metabolism gene module deconvolution. (A) Heatmap showing the lipid
  metabolism module genes in the five cell types. (B) Top GOs enriched in AS genes.
  All 3 GO terms were based on Biological Processes (BP). (C) Top GOs enriched in
  MG genes. Fatty acid metabolic process and Regulation of cholesterol metabolic process
  were based on BP, while PPAR signaling pathway was based on WikiPathways. (D) Top
  GOs enriched in OG genes based on BP. (E) Correlation network of selected module
  genes from AS, MG and OG. (F) Dot plot showing gene fold changes of old versus young
  animals from our deconvoluted data, Ximerakis et al., Allen et al., and Lee et al.
  AS genes are denoted in dark blue, MG genes in pink, and OG genes in gold.
