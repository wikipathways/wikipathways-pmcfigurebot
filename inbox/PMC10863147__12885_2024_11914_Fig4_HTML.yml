caption: Identification of a 73-gene panel enriched in traffic-related structures
  and vesicle dynamics in PRNPhigh samples and PRNP+ GBM cells. A Venn diagram of
  the 73 common genes with increased expression levels in PRNPhigh GBM cells (TCGA
  bulk RNA-seq) and upregulated in PRNP+ cells (Darmanis et al., Neftel et al. and
  Richards et al.). B Over-representation analysis (gProfiler2 - GO, KEGG, Reactome,
  and WikiPathways) of common genes found in (A). C Schematic workflow of the analysis
  of an in-house cohort of GBM patient-derived samples. D Relative expression of PRNP,
  SYPL1, DSTN, ANXA1 and RAB31 in patient-derived GBM samples expressing Low (n=26)
  or High (n=26) PRNP levels by RT-qPCR and 2-ΔΔCt, normalized by HPRT, GUSB and TBP.
