caption: Key biological pathways associated with advancing histology in epithelial
  and stromal compartments. AOIs are ordered by segment, region and by sample ID.
  Unsupervised clustering of gene set enrichment scores (ssGSEA) calculated using
  gene sets from the WikiPathways database. All pathways with a significant association
  with histology, either in PanCK or Vimentin segments, are included (FDR<0.05). Main
  clusters of identified pathways are indicated with white horizontal lines. The corresponding
  Spearman correlation coefficient, Rho, between histology as ordinal variable and
  the enrichment scores are indicated for each pathway in PanCK and Vimentin segments
  separately (dotted heatmap). FDR is calculated using Benjamini-Hochberg method.
  An unsupervised version of this heatmap, using unsupervised clustering for both
  rows and columns, is included as . AOI, area of illumination; FDR, false discovery
  rate; PanCK, pan-cytokeratin; ssGSEA, single sample gene set enrichment.
