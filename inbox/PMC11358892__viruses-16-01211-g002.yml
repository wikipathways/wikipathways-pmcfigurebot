caption: (a) All differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared, such as “C vs.
  NP”, “C vs. SP”, and “NP vs. SP, referring to the common 291 DEGs. Functional enrichment
  analysis (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), WikiPathways
  (WP), and the comprehensive resource of mammalian protein complexes (CORUM)) of
  the common 291 DEGs. (b) Upregulated DEGs among all comparisons and 1436 extended
  common upregulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis of common 1436 up-DEGs.
  (c) Downregulated DEGs among all comparisons and 71 extended common downregulated
  genes. Functional enrichment analysis of the common 71 down-DEGs. The green circle
  in the Venn diagram represents DEGs in the “C vs. NP” comparison, the blue circle
  represents DEGs in the “C vs. NP” comparison, and the red circle represents DEGs
  in the “NP vs. SP” comparison.
