caption: Here we report the oxidative stress and redox pathway from Wikipathways.
  DEGs from our data are reported in red (upregulated) or green (downregulated) according
  to their expression behavior. The figure was obtained from Wikipathways website
  and colored based on our data. The color intensity is based on a +9 to âˆ’9 scale
  that summarizes in how many conditions each transcript was significantly dysregulated
  (from upregulated at all time-steps and dosages to downregulated at all time-steps
  and dosages).
