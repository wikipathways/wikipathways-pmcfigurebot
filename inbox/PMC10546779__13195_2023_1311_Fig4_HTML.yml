caption: 'Identification of 326 phagocytic AD MG DEGs and relevant function. A Functional-validated
  human Aβ phagocytic AD MG DEGs. The embedded dashed box shows identification of
  184 upregulated and 193 downregulated Aβ + MG DEGs in GSE165306. MG were isolated
  from the Cerebrum of AD 5xFAD tg mice injected with florescent Methoxy-X04 (MeX04)
  that labels Aβ plaque and sorted for Aβ + and Aβ − populations for further scRNA-seq
  analysis. The Aβ + MG DEGs were identified with FC ≥ 1.5 and adjusted p-value < 0.05
  and overlapped with the previously identified functional-validated human AD MG DEGs.
  B The functional-validated mouse Aβ phagocytic AD MG DEGs were identified by overlapping
  the Aβ + MG DEG with the previously identified mouse AD MG DEGs using the same strategy
  in A. C Identification of phagocytic modifier AD MG DEGs. MG genetic modifiers of
  phagocytosis were identified by conducting a phagocytic genetic modifier screening
  using CRISPR-Cas9 for knockout of genes encoding membrane proteins, drug targets,
  kinases, or phosphatases in the BV2 cell line derived from phagocytic microglia
  (PMID: 30,944,478). The Venn diagram shows the overlap of BV2 cell phagocytic modifier
  genes with AD MG DEGs of human and mouse. D Gene sets related to endocytosis. A
  total of 2172 genes involved in biological processes of endocytosis, exocytosis,
  and transcytosis were collected from GO, KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways. E Overlapped
  endocytosis-related AD MG DEGs. The overlap analysis of 2172 endocytosis-related
  genes with 409 human and 777 mouse AD MG DEGs identified 16 overlapped endocytosis-related
  AD MG DEGs in human and mouse. F Total phagocytic AD MG DEG is summarized. Aβ, amyloid
  beta; AD, Alzheimer’s disease; DEG, differentially expressed gene; FC, fold change;
  i, inhibit; i.p., intraperitoneally; MeX04, Methoxy-X04; MG, microglia; MIF, macrophage
  migration inhibitory factor; p, promote; SC, single cell; TGN, trans-Golgi-network'
