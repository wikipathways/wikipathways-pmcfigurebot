caption: 'Identification of significant DEGs induced by sedanolide in luciferases-expressing
  HepG2 cells. (A) The number of significant DEGs. Red: upregulation, blue: downregulation.
  (B) Volcano plot of RNA-seq results of sedanolide-treated cells versus control cells.
  Differential gene expression with log2-normalized fold changes (FCs) in sedanolide-treated
  cells (n = 3) or control cells (n = 3) plotted against −log10 FDR. Red dots: upregulated
  significant DEGs in sedanolide-treated cells (FC > 1.5, FDR < 0.05); blue dots:
  downregulated significant DEGs in sedanolide-treated cells (FC < −1.5, FDR < 0.05).
  (C) Pathway enrichment analysis in sedanolide-treated cells compared with control
  cells, as determined by the WikiPathways analysis. Upregulated genes belonging to
  the corresponding pathways are summarized in the right panel.'
